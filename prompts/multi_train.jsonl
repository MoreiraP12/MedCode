{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 20-year-old nonalcoholic, nonsmoker Nepalese man with no significant past medical history presented to the outpatient department with melena for 10 days. This was associated with fatigue and generalized weakness of the body. He denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or recent weight loss. He also gave a history of low-grade fever with an evening rise of temperature for the same duration. It was not associated with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, runny nose, watery eyes, or sore throat. He had no history of similar illness in the past or any recent sick contacts. His family history was unremarkable.\nVitals on presentation revealed blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and temperature 100.5\u00b0F. On physical examination, he was pale and icteric. There were no edema, ecchymosis, or any palpable lymph nodes. Chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds over the right infrascapular region. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.\nBlood investigations showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.3 g/dL and white blood cells (WBC) 5400/mm3 with neutrophils 79% and lymphocytes 18%, and platelets 319 000/mm3. His renal function tests showed urea 4.5 mmol/L and creatinine 95 \u03bcmol/L. Liver function test (LFT) showed total bilirubin 66 \u03bcmol/L, direct bilirubin 7 \u03bcmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 23 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 38 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 161 U/L. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 1450 U/L. Direct Coombs test was positive for antibodies against red blood cells.\nSerologies were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Serological evaluation for antinuclear antibody (ANA), antidouble-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (ds-DNA), and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) were negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was made, and the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily.\nDue to the presenting complaint of melena, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which revealed a peptic ulcer in the first part of the duodenum. A tissue sample was taken during endoscopy, which did not reveal Helicobacter pylori. He was treated with proton pump inhibitors for his peptic ulcer disease.\nMeanwhile, a chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). The pleural fluid analysis showed an exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance, lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio of 4, and high adenosine deaminase activity (89 units/L). Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest with and without contrast showed multiple centriacinar nodules giving tree in bud appearance, fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, and moderate right-sided pleural effusion suggestive of tubercular pathology. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was not visualized in the microscopic analysis of the sputum. However, due to high clinical suspicion, corroborative pleural fluid analysis and chest imaging findings, he was started on antitubercular treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nFollow-up laboratories showed Hb stable at 5-7 g/dL. Platelet count decreased to 127 000/mm3 at the time of discharge (Figure ). Following discharge on antitubercular medications and prednisone, he was lost to follow up.\nThe patient presented to our clinic after 3 months following an exacerbation of his symptoms after the inadvertent stopping of his prednisone. He presented with increased fatigue, generalized weakness, and jaundice. He had no preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms. Blood investigation this time showed Hb: 4 g/dL, WBC: 6500/mm3, and platelets: 10 000/mm3. LFT showed total bilirubin: 48.05 \u03bcmol/L and direct bilirubin: 13.51 \u03bcmol/L. LDH was elevated to 851 U/L.\nThe development of thrombocytopenia in a patient with pre-existing autoimmune hemolytic anemia led us to consider the possibility of Evans syndrome as the cause of bicytopenia. He was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g once daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 60 mg daily. However, there was no improvement in his Hb or platelet count. We considered other immunosuppressive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and cyclosporine as possible treatment options, but we faced two challenges with their use: fear of reactivation of TB and the prohibitive cost. Eventually, we decided to start him on cyclosporine, given its affordable cost despite the risk of reactivation of TB. He was discharged on oral cyclosporine 10 mg daily for a month. Unfortunately, he was again lost to follow up.\n\nWhat is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?", "output": "### Response:\n0.497", "task": "calc"}

She was born at full term after an uneventful pregnancy. At birth, her weight was 3.062 kg (35th centile), her length was 48.3 cm (32nd centile), and her head circumference was not available. Her early motor development was normal. She had delayed speech with first words at 18 months, followed by additional developmental delays and eventual development of cognitive impairment. At 3 years, she was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, due to loss of social and behavioral skills starting around 2 years of age, sensitivity to loud sounds, impaired coordination, and difficulties with balance.\nShe had a history of behavioral aggression throughout her schooling, particularly with regard to ownership and sharing, which intensified between 16 and 17 years of age, associated with diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. She had one acute out-of-character behavioral episode, characterized by disinhibited behavior and unusual delusions, without hallucinations, lasting a few days at age 17, for which brain MRI, 24-h continuous EEG, and subsequent neurological evaluation were negative. She has never had any observed seizures.\nIn an assessment at 18 years, she was noted to need substantial help with self-care activities and could not understand or follow instructions. Her interactions and behaviors were immature, characterized as a 4-year-old level by her school evaluations. She had short stature and obesity (weight 88.2 kg, > 98th centile; height 153.0 cm, 6th centile; BMI 37.7 kg/m2, 98th centile) with macrocephaly (head circumference 58 cm; > 98th centile) (Table ). She had a history of continuously gorging or binge eating to the point of vomiting, requiring her parents to restrict her food intake.\nShe was mildly dysmorphic, with sparse lateral eyebrows, telecanthus, left preauricular pit, prominent cupid bow configuration of the upper lip, and slack facial expression. She had numerous self-inflicted, skin-picking lesions on her arms, in various stages of healing, and one hyperplastic keloidal scar elsewhere. Her speech was fluent but very simple, with sound substitution errors very typical of a young child. There was periodic echolalia, in addition to outbursts of out-of-context speech, without regard to interrupting other speakers. Negative genetic testing included Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome methylation and MLPA, fragile X, and CNV analysis via SNP microarray. However, areas of homozygosity were identified across multiple chromosomes, with an overall percentage of autosomal/genomic homozygosity of 2.5%. No candidate recessive genes were identified within the homozygous regions. As no specific disease could be suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation, family trio sequencing of GeneDx\u2019s Autism/ID Xpanded Panel with 2308 genes was performed, using oral rinse samples from her and both parents.

The patient had a seven-day history of cough, fever, myalgia, and malaise before presentation. His medical history included diabetes, diverticulitis, and hyperlipidemia. Home medications included atorvastatin, clomiphene, insulin Humalog 16 units subcutaneous before meal and bedtime, canagliflozin, Levemir, 54 units subcutaneous daily, lisinopril, and metformin. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl on routine laboratory testing prior to admission. He had no family history of kidney disease. He did not use tobacco or illicit drugs.\nIn the emergency department (ED), the patient was afebrile, oral temperature 97.6, blood pressure 105 mmHg systolic and 58 mmHg diastolic, tachycardic heart rate (HR) 128, tachypneic respiratory rate (RR) 28, blood glucose level 559 mg/dL, arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH arterial 7.11, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) arterial 16, PCO2 total arterial 6, HCO3 arterial 5.1, PCO2 arterial 66. Arterial blood gas findings in the setting of hyperglycemia were consistent with DKA. Findings were further confirmed by positive ketonuria on urinalysis (UA). He was also found to have lactic acid level of 4.2 mmol/L in the setting of regular metformin use at home.\nInitial blood and urinary examination are shown in Table . Renal function was abnormal (blood creatinine 2.96 mg/dL) and hematuria and proteinuria were detected. Complete metabolic panel also revealed serum sodium 124 mmol/L, potassium 7 mmol/L, bicarbonate 8 mmol/L, glucose 525 mg/dL, elevated anion gap of 31. Inflammatory markers were elevated (lactate dehydrogenase level 501 IU/L, C reactive protein 32.7 mg/L, ferritin level 2951 ng/mL, and procalcitonin level 4.31 mg/ml). The chest X-ray showed mild patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities. Patient was tested for COVID-19 and he tested positive.\nClinical course\nIn the ED, the patient was hypoxic O2 saturation 85% on room air. The patient was started on nasal cannula oxygen with minimal improvement in saturation after which he was put on 15 L of high flow nasal cannula oxygen without any improvement in O2 saturation. Then the patient was given etomidate 20 mg IV, succinylcholine 150 mg IV and was intubated and put on ventilator support. The patient was then admitted to intensive care unit. The patient was found hypotensive 90/52 mmHg after intubation and was started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. The patient was given 10 units of insulin as bolus with maintenance insulin drip. He was also administered azithromycin 500 mg IV and ceftriaxone 1 g IV and was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.\nNephrology was consulted due to worsening kidney function, hyperkalemia, and decreased urine output. The patient was started on continuous renal replacement (CRRT) on hospital day two, about 27 hrs after admission. CRRT was provided as continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration using a Prismaflex CRRT machine (Baxter Inc, Deerfield, IL). The prescribed dose is 25 ml/kg/h. We used titratable anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin after CRRT was started. After a week on CRRT the patient continues to have hypoxia requiring prone positioning and mechanical ventilation. The patient was given convalescent plasma on hospital day six as an experimental treatment due to worsening respiratory status and multiorgan failure. On day nine, the patient continues to have minimal urine output, he was transfused convalescent plasma again, no remdesivir or tocilizumab was given during the hospitalization. The patient received dexamethasone since hospital day six for total eight days. The patient also had a thromboembolic event, he was found to have acute thrombosis of left common femoral vein, femoral and popliteal vein on hospital day 33, he remained on IV heparin which was later transitioned to coumadin.\nOn hospital day 19, the patient remained intubated, off pressor, CRRT was discontinued, serum creatinine was 3.44 mg/dL on CRRT that increased to 5.23 mg/dL the next day. On hospital day 20, he was started on hemodialysis. He was continued on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule. Patient underwent tracheostomy on day 24. The patient was weaned off ventilator on day 30 and placed on trach collar. Prior to day 42 the patient remained oliguric. The patient since then started to make good urine output gradually >30 cc/hr and received last hemodialysis on day 45. On day 48, serum creatinine level improved to 1.30 mg/dL after he stopped dialysis since hospital day 45 (Table ). He was tested for COVID 19 again on day 32 and test was repeated for next two days, all tests came back negative.

The physical examination was normal. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a complete right branch block, and posterior left hemiblock (), and PR interval was 120 ms. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function.\nElectrophysiological study (EPS) was performed by intracardiac route in this patient with unexplained syncope and atypical ECG. We recorded a regular sinus rhythm, an AH interval was 150 ms, and HV interval was \u221224 ms. Programmed atrial stimulation was performed in the basal state and showed an effective atrial refractory period of right atrium at 200 ms and effective refractory period of accessory tract was 300 ms (). The QRS had the same morphology during atrial pacing. We found a dissociation atrioventricular conduction in retrograde. We inserted a catheter of exploration in coronary sinus; we recorded a shorter AV at the distal electrode of decapolar that confirmed the diagnosis of a left accessory bypass (). The use of isoproterenol (isuprel) showed a classic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with slurred initial QRS. This ECG showed fusion of antergrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node (). AH interval with isuprel was 100 ms and HV interval was 42 ms. This was explicated by an accelerated atrioventricular conduction with isuprel in addition to accessory pathway (). The effective refractory period of accessory pathway was 210 ms with isuprel (). We supposed that atrial fibrillation caused ventricular fibrillation responsible for syncope. Thus, we had decided to ablate the accessory pathway ().\nAfter accessory pathway ablation, the patient was in nodal AV block with QRS complexes of normal duration (0.10 s). In Atrial pacing, an anterograde Wenckebach cycle length was 130/BAT (suprahisian AV block).

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 30-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea on exertion and severe left anterior chest pain that had begun about 30 minutes prior to arrival, and which increased in intensity over time. She reported a history of exertional chest pain that had begun 10 days prior to her presentation. Previous studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and an exercise treadmill test had shown no abnormalities. Her chest pain had been slightly alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerine. The patient had no smoking history and had no cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. The patient had been diagnosed with ET 6 months previously at a workplace health screening, and was being treated with 100 mg aspirin, 500 mg hydroxyurea twice a day, and 1 mg anagrelide three times daily. Her ET was relatively well controlled without any other complications, and her platelet counts had been within the normal range. Initial vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 78 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. S1 and S2 were normal and S4 was faintly audible at the apex. An ECG showed T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and in V2 through V5, which were consistent with myocardial ischemia (). Neither cardiomegaly nor pulmonary congestion was noted on a chest X-ray. The MB fraction of creatinine phosphokinase (CK-MB) was 8.5 ng/mL and cardiac troponin I was 3.08 ng/mL (upper normal limit, 0.07 ng/mL). B-type natriuretic peptide (100 pg/mL) was also slightly elevated. A complete blood count showed the following: a leukocyte count of 3.70\u00d7103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 388\u00d7103/\u00b5L. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 54 mg/dL. An echocardiograph revealed hypokinesis in the anteroseptal wall and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. These results were compatible with an acute, non-ST-elevation MI. Immediately, the patient was treated with anti-platelet therapy (300 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel). In addition, according to the early invasive strategy, coronary angiography was performed, which revealed significant segmental stenosis (90%) of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) (). The segmental lesion in the mid LAD did not respond to intracoronary nitroglycerin injection, which excluded coronary spasms as the causative factor (). An intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) scan showed a focal soft plaque with a ruptured cap and thrombus formation (). Percutaneous coronary angioplasty and stenting (Promus, 3.5\u00d718 mm) were performed successfully. After coronary angioplasty, the chest pain and T-wave inversions on ECG disappeared.

Per the family, he used to be overweight four years ago. The patient has been living in Haiti his entire life and recently migrated to the United States one month ago. Per the patient\u2019s family, he has had chronic abdominal pain for five years associated with weight loss of nearly 100 lbs. His family also reported that he had poor nutritional intake; he could only eat a small amount before he seemed to be in pain, and eventually refused to eat. He also exhibited constipation, passing small hard stools once every few days. He had no other prior medical history, no family history of malignancy, no history of trauma or surgeries, no history of smoking or substance use, and did not take any medications. The gastroenterology team was consulted to investigate the etiology of abdominal pain and chronic weight loss.\n \nThe patient was non-verbal but did follow some commands. When asked to point to the area of pain, he pointed to his epigastrium. He was unable to assist much further in answering questions.\nHis vital signs were normal. His height was 5\u2019 8\u201d, weight was 90 lbs, and body mass index (BMI) was 13.7 kg/m2. Physical exam revealed a thin cachectic male with a scaphoid abdomen and mild tenderness in the epigastrium. His abdomen was otherwise soft and non-distended with normal bowel sounds, no guarding or rebound tenderness, and Murphy\u2019s sign could not be elicited. No abdominal bruit could be heard on auscultation. His skin was dry with tenting and his mucous membranes were dry. There was no scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary exam was normal. He was nonverbal, but cooperative and calm, with spontaneous movement observed in all extremities without evidence of focal weakness. There were no signs of skin rash or bruising.\nLabs were significant for mild normocytic anemia with hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL. Chemistry panel was normal. Hepatic function panel showed a mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at 60 U/L and 74 U/L, respectively, mildly reduced albumin at 3.4 g/dL and elevated alkaline phosphatase at 199 U/L. Lactic acid, amylase, lipase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein were normal. Stool samples were negative for bacteria, viruses, ova and parasites. Abdominal X-ray revealed a normal bowel gas pattern without signs of obstruction.\nAbdominal duplex and computed tomography abdominal angiography were performed (Figures -).\nThe mesenteric vascular duplex revealed patency of the abdominal aorta with a peak velocity of 152 cm/second (Figure ), whereas examination of the celiac trunk demonstrated severe grade stenosis with a pre-stenotic velocity of 152 cm/second and a remarkably high post-stenotic velocity of 520 cm/second (Figure ). The pre-stenosis velocity to post-stenosis velocity ratio was greater than 3:1. Interestingly, the peak velocity did not vary significantly with respiration, which may have indicated chronic fibrotic changes in the wall of the celiac artery secondary to compression over time. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography of the abdomen revealed acute angle J-configuration of the takeoff of the celiac axis, with stenosis (red arrow) at its origin and focal post-stenotic dilatation (Figure ). Thus, the diagnosis of celiac artery compression syndrome was made.

Her menarche was at 18 years old, and her menopause at age of 56. She had a normal menstrual history before menopause and had no postmenopausal bleeding. She had two healthy children and no miscarriages. She denied taking estrogen, progesterone or health care products. There are no similar patients in her family.\nOn physical examination, she was 153 cm tall and weighed 53 kg with body mass index of 22.6 kg/m2. Increased hair was observed in her upper lip and armpit (Ferriman- Gallwey score of 8), and a physical examination of genital revealed clitoromegaly. There was no acne, deepening of the voice or other virilization signs. Findings on examination of the head and neck, breasts and abdomen were unremarkable. She had no signs of Cushing syndrome, or acanthosis nigricans syndrome.\nThe hormonal test showed high total testosterone levels (714.8 ng/dL, reference value 14\u201356). Serum DHEAS (145.8 ng/mL, reference value 25.9\u2013460.2), androstenedione (2.4 ng/mL, reference value 0.3\u20133.3) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (1.7 nmol/l, reference value 0\u201311.5) levels were within normal range. The serum values of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin were also within the normal range for the menopause. The levels of anti-mullerian hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), plasma renin activity and aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, 24-h urinary free cortisol, and 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test were in normal range. The ovarian tumor markers (Ca 125, CEA, Ca 199) were in normal reference range. The repeated samples confirmed that her high testosterone levels were within the tumor range. We excluded overt Cushing Syndrome on the basis of normal cortisol suppression after 1 mg dexamethasone and normal urinary free cortisol levels, as recently proposed by Ceccato F []. Then a middle dosage dexamethasone test (0.75 mg, 4 times a day for 5 consecutive days) without testosterone inhibition strongly suggested the potential androgen-producing tumor, further examinations were needed to distinguish ovarian or adrenal origin of hyperandrogenemia.\nInitially, the lack of co-secretion of DHEAS and androstenedione indicated that her elevated testosterone might be of ovarian origin. However, pelvic ultrasound disclosed that there was no ovarian mass, while adrenal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule in the left adrenal gland. Further pelvic magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed submucous myoma of uterus, but no abnormal of ovarian, and adrenal CT scan was also performed and a left adrenal mass of about 1.5 cm in diameter was revealed (Fig. a and b). PET-CT confirmed a round nodule in the external branch of the left adrenal gland with slight increase in FDG metabolism (the SUV max of the nodule was 2.56), considering the possibility of benign adenoma. No ovarian abnormalities or other ectopic tumors were found by PET-CT.\nBased on the clinical characteristics, hormone detection and imaging appearances of the case, pure testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent a laparoscopic resection of left adrenal tumor. Histological examination (Fig. a) and immunohistochemistry also confirmed the diagnosis of benign adrenocortical adenoma with immunohistochemistry positive for inhibin \u03b1, melan A, \u03b2-captenin (Fig. b-d), SYN (focal), Ki-67 (< 3%), and negative for chromogranin (CgA), cytokeratin (CK), S-100, P53. The level of testosterone decreased to 15.8 ng/dl on the 3rd day after operation, and the symptoms of virilization were alleviated during the follow-up, which further confirms the adrenal etiology of the testosterone production.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n46.043", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 66-year-old man was diagnosed 28 years ago to have diffuse scleroderma which manifested as diffuse skin tightness, telangiectasias, dysphagia, arthralgias, and Raynaud's phenomena. Disease had been quiet over many years with no worsening in any of his symptoms and no evidence of cardiac, pulmonary, or renal involvement. Thus, the patient was not receiving any specific treatment for scleroderma.\nFew months prior to presentation, patient noticed change in his condition with fatigue, weight loss (20 kilograms in 4 months), and generalized feeling of not being well. At that time, patient did not seek any medical attention. Two weeks before presentation, patient developed progressive abdominal distention resulting in significant discomfort. Medical evaluation at presentation revealed normal vital signs, palor, and fluid in the abdomen, in addition to the findings of chronic scleroderma (diffuse tight skin, fish mouth appearance, and telangiectasias). There were no palpable masses or enlarged lymph nodes. Lungs were clear, heart exam was within normal limits with no murmurs or rubs, and there was no evidence of peripheral edema.\nPatient underwent abdominal fluid tap. A sample of the ascitic fluid was sent for analysis. It revealed inflammatory cells with no suspicious malignant cells. Two weeks later, ascites recurred. At that time, patient was admitted to the hospital for full workup. Complete blood count revealed anemia with hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL and borderline white blood cell count (4.4 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L) and platelet count (176000/\u00b5L). Lab tests also revealed hypercalcemia (10.3 mg/dL) with low albumin (31 g/L) and elevated globulin (50 g/L) levels. Thyroid function tests were normal. Renal parameters were also within normal limits. Patient underwent Echocardiography to assess cardiac function and rule out heart disease as the cause of ascites. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric hypertrophy, mild mitral valve and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 35 mm Hg. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed to screen for malignancy, revealed marked abdominal and pelvic ascites with no masses or enlarged lymph nodes. Ascitic tap was repeated and fluid was sent again for analysis. Results revealed inflammatory cells with no malignant cells and negative culture results. Patient was started on spironolactone 50 milligrams daily and furosemide 40 milligrams daily.\nMultiple myeloma was suspected based on anemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperglobulinemia, in addition to symptoms of weight loss and fatigue. Protein electrophoresis was done and showed monoclonal gammopathy. Immunofixation revealed IgA kappa pattern (). Results of bone marrow biopsy revealed 45% plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed a pattern consistent with multiple myeloma (strong expression of CD 138 in tumor cells).\nA diagnosis of multiple myeloma was thus established. Further studies were obtained for disease staging. Beta-2-microglobulin level was 7.9 mg/L. X-ray skeletal series revealed osteopenia but no lytic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, performed to assess the liver and spleen, failed to demonstrate any evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis and thus failed to provide a clear explanation for ascites in this patient.\nPatient was started on chemotherapy (Bortezomib, dexamethasone, and zoledronic acid). After six cycles of treatment, there was a major improvement in his disease condition with amelioration of anemia and normalization of globulin levels. Patient continued to have abdominal and pelvic fluid collection. However, the time interval separating the required abdominocentesis procedures increased gradually from around two weeks to around four weeks, suggesting a decrease in the quantity and rate of fluid collection. No change was noted in his scleroderma symptoms, neither worsening nor improvement.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nPatient 1 was an 85-year-old woman, height 166 cm, weight 39 kg, and who smoked 10 cigarettes/day. She was retired but had worked fulltime at a desk job until the age of 65 years. She had RA with severe destruction and deformation of the joints in her hands, fingers, wrists, shoulders, hips knees, ankles, and feet. Her hands were especially affected and all the fingers on both hands were subluxated, partially preventing her from using a pen, fork, or dress. She had suffered from neck pain for more than 2 years. Over a couple of weeks, she had rapidly lost the ability to walk, was EMS 9 (grade 2), and her neck pain had increased to unbearable (VAS 10), although she had no arm pain. At physical examination, she presented with cervical myelopathy (Ranawat 3b[). Her legs were weak, and although she could move them when lying in bed she was unable to stand or walk. Hoffman's sign was positive, and her lower extremities showed hyperreflexia. Preoperative CT revealed vertical instability, VAAI 0.22 (Fig. A), with severe destruction and lateral subluxation of the AA joint (Fig. B) and odontoid fracture. Preoperative MRI revealed spinal cord compression by the atlas. Cervical traction with 4 kg for 2 days improved the patient's neurological symptoms and gross alignment. We performed C1\u2013C2 fusion with a spacer in the right AA joint (Fig. D), a C1 claw (right side), a C1 lateral mass screw (left side), and bilateral C2 pedicle screws. The patient's myelopathy improved without C1 decompression (postoperative VAAI 0.69, Fig. C).

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 47-year-old Hispanic male presented with lower back pain, and lethargy. The symptoms started approximately 1 week before presentation. The patient denied having any upper respiratory symptoms, rash, or joint pain. The patient also denied having any gross hematuria, foamy urine, or any other urinary symptoms. The patient\u2019s history included GPA, diagnosed by a renal biopsy 2 years ago, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diverticulosis requiring colostomy.\nHis medication at the time included simvastatin, lisinopril, azathioprine, and insulin. His azathioprine was reduced from 200 mg/day to 100 mg/day 6 months before presentation. He had recently lost his job and insurance, and denied smoking, alcohol use, or any substance abuse. On physical examination, he was afebrile. His blood pressure was 99/51 mmHg, pulse was 74 beats/minute, and respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, height was 165 cm, and weight was 97 kg. He was in no apparent distress. The patient\u2019s lungs were clear, heart sounds were regular without any murmur, rub, or gallop, the abdomen was soft, and no edema or skin rash was present.\nLaboratory data revealed the patient\u2019s blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to be 73 mg/dL and serum creatinine (Scr) 5.2 mg/dL with otherwise normal electrolytes, hemoglobin 12.7 mg/dL, platelets 257,000/mm3, albumin 3.5 mg/dL, and normal liver enzymes. Two years prior to current presentation his Scr level was 1.5 mg/dl. Urinalysis showed large protein, large blood, many dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood cell casts. The urine protein to creatinine ratio was 2.03 mg/mg. Renal sonogram revealed kidney sizes of 11.3 cm and 10.6 cm on right and left kidneys, respectively, without any evidence of obstruction and an unremarkable bladder with no significant postvoid residual volume.\nThe patient was started on high dose pulse methylprednisolone intravenously (1 g/day for 3 days), and his azathioprine dose was increased to 200 mg/day. His serology showed normal complement titers, negative hepatitis profile, and mildly elevated rheumatoid factor at 24 IU/ml (normal <14). ANCA serology showed proteinase-3 (PR3) antibody (anti-PR3, cytoplasmic c-ANCA) reactive at low levels \u22124.1 (<1.0 reported as negative) and negative myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody (anti-MPO, perinuclear p-ANCA). Anti-GBM titers were negative.\nBased on clinical presentation and the patient\u2019s past medical history, it was presumed that the most likely cause of worsening renal function was a relapse of GPA. However, very low levels of anti-PR3 antibodies, and the questionable duration of the progression of the patient\u2019s renal disease prompted the nephrology team to proceed with a repeat kidney biopsy.\nThe kidney biopsy showed focal segmental necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, with weak linear staining of IgG, which was not seen on previous biopsy. Out of 19 glomeruli examined, nine showed complete or near complete global sclerosis. Crescents were seen in eleven of 19 glomeruli. The other biopsy findings included moderate tubular atrophy, moderate interstitial fibrosis with inflammation, and moderate arteriosclerosis ( and ). The pathologist reported findings suggestive of moderate disease activity and moderate chronicity. Although the biopsy indicated some evidence of chronic disease, there was still significant active disease that should be treated. Provided that the disease process responded to the treatment, there was a possibility of at least partial recovery of renal function.\nThe biopsy findings presented a treatment dilemma. The patient had a history of GPA and initially presented with PICGN and crescentic glomerulonephritis with negative IF findings 2 years previously (). At that time, he was treated with pulse methylprednisolone followed by 6 months of oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide, which successfully induced remission. His renal function had improved; Scr decreased from 3.1 mg/dL to 1.5 mg/dL and proteinuria decreased from 2.3 g/day to <500 mg/day. He was then switched to maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine. At the time of his initial presentation, his anti-PR3 level was >100 U/ml. After initial induction therapy, anti-PR3 level was reduced below assay limits and remained negative during follow up.\nThis patient was treated with pulse dose of intravenous methyl prednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days followed by maintenance oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day. He was also treated with monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg). Three months later, the patient had partially responded with proteinuria decreasing to 800 mg/day and Cr stabilizing to 2.8 mg/dL.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n61.41", "task": "calc"}

She gave a history of five episodes of fresh rectal bleeding with blood separate from the stools, of one day's duration. This was preceded by one day of loose stools and a constant low grade central abdominal pain. There were no other associated upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms and no systemic disturbance. Past medical history included atrial fibrillation for which she was prescribed warfarin. She was a nonsmoker with minimal alcohol intake.\nOn examination, body mass index was 23 and blood pressure 140/70 with an irregular heart rate of 80 bpm, a respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Examination of the abdomen elicited tenderness in the periumbilical region with no peritonism. On digital rectal examination the rectum was empty with no masses and no perianal disease. Dark blood was noted on the glove with no clots. Haematological and biochemical investigation revealed haemoglobin was 103 g/L (normal range 115\u2013160 g/L), C-reactive protein 210 mg/L (<10 mg/L), and international normalised ratio 4.47 (target 2.5). Urea and electrolytes, liver function, and serum amylase were normal. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation.\nThe patient was managed with intravenous fluid replacement and 10 mg vitamin K. Warfarin was stopped. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed with no polyps or masses identified and fresh blood and clots seen throughout the sigmoid colon. The patient continued to report bleeding and repeat haemoglobin had decreased to 81 g/L. Two units of packed red cells were transfused and an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed atrophic gastritis and a prepyloric erosion unlikely to be the source of bleeding. Following this computed tomography (CT) angiography showed a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with associated collection and fistula to the transverse colon at the level of the splenic flexure ().\nRadiology consult was obtained and the pseudoaneurysm embolised via catheter directed metallic microcoils. Upon completion no further contrast extravasation was seen, with cessation of flow through the fistula (). Rectal bleeding ceased and there were no complications.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 11-year-old Caucasian boy was admitted into our unit with diffuse abdominal pain, cold sweats, confusion, tremor, and paresthesias. The patient came from a rural area, where he lived in a community with limited resources. His mother was 38, in apparent good health, and his father had died at the age of 50 (i.e., 3 years before the admission) from acute myocardial infarction. The patient had a 9-year-old sister with no significant medical history. The pregnancy was uneventful, with vaginal delivery at 39 weeks. The boy had no perinatal pathology, but since the age of 7 had presented numerous respiratory infections and uninvestigated mild psychic retardation. History revealed several episodes of faintness, myalgias, paraesthesias, and unexplained irritability; his mother also reported unusual hunger and tachycardia occurring mainly in the morning hours or after physical exercise. The symptoms started 5 months before the admission in the hospital service. He was admitted twice in a county hospital; although it was noticed that hypoglycemia (ranging from 14 to 38 mg/dL) would promptly return to normal values after glucose intravenous infusion, the levels of circulating insulin, as well as the abdominal ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, were reported within normal range. The patient was finally diagnosed with \u201cidiopathic intermittent\u201d hypoglycemia. An informed consent was given by his mother upon admission; clinical examination revealed an impaired general condition, normal skin color, marked hypotrophy of stature, and weight (weight = 19.5 kg, height = 132 cm, body mass index = 17.7 kg/m2). The vital signs were as follows: temperature 98.4\u00b0F, heart rate 121 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and blood pressure 96/67 mm Hg without any orthostatic changes. Physical examination revealed the following aspects: normal shaped head with no sign of trauma, intact extraocular muscles, equal and round pupils, reactive to light and accommodation, normal nostrils; well hydrated and lesion free oral cavity, with moist mucous membranes; lungs were clear to auscultation; regular heart rate and rhythm, with no murmurs; cold extremities; soft abdomen, presenting with no tenderness or distension, positive bowel sounds, no organic masses were noted. The patient described paresthesias, irritability, confusion, dizziness, and tremor; he was hypokinetic, presenting with uncoordinated movements of the extremities and slight limb spasticity. Neuropsychiatric examination ascertained the patient had a mild mental retardation. During hospitalization, the glycemic curves showed recurring values <50 mg/dL associated with low glycated hemoglobin (reported value: 3.90%; normal value: 4%\u20136%), a fasting insulinemia of 12.6 \u03bcU/mL (normal value <6 \u03bcU/mL) together with a postprandial insulinemia of 72.1 \u03bcU/mL, and elevated C-peptide level (reported value: 6.42 ng/mL; normal value <2 ng/mL). The urine sample was normal. Low serum glucose levels were closely monitored, and the patient received continuous intravenous serum glucose and electrolyte solutions. The pancreatic ultrasound was inconclusive, but the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high signal focal area with a diameter of 1 cm, located in the tail of pancreas (Figure ).\nConsidering the case history, the clinical, biochemical and imaging findings, and excluding other causes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia\u2014such as exogenous insulin administration or accidental ingestion of oral antidiabetic medicine\u2014the patient was temporarily diagnosed with hypoglycemia-inducing caudal pancreatic tumor, which was a clear indication for surgical treatment. The patient underwent an open surgical procedure. Complete mobilization and careful exploration of the pancreas revealed a firm nodule located in the tail of the pancreas which was easily enucleated; the piece was routinely fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for pathological examination. The excised tumor measuring 1 cm in diameter was well-circumscribed, softer than the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma, and had a yellow-brownish cut surface that did not appear to be necrotic or cystic (Figure ). Further immunohistochemical examination of the operative piece was positive for chromogranin A associated with the cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules of the tumor cells and approximately 8% of nuclear Ki67 positivity (Figures and ). The patient's immediate postoperative course was uneventful. Plasma insulin values promptly returned to normal, but transient hyperglycemia occurred and lasted for approximately 48 hours. However, no further episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded. The patient was discharged without hypoglycemic symptoms 8 days later. He currently has a favorable evolution in the clinical follow-up, presenting with weight gain and progressive remission to complete disappearance of most symptoms\u2014except for the mental impairments.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

The genital examination and rectal digital exploration findings were normal. The patient reported no family history of collagen diseases and had no cardiac or vascular disorders. The blood pressure was within the normal range, and body weight was 75 kg with a height of 172 cm.\nA fractionated culture of the ejaculate was performed, together with urine cytology, urine cultures for fungi, parasites and bacteria (including tuberculosis), biochemical testing, blood count, coagulation, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. All the parameters were within normal limits. The urine and semen cultures were negative.\nTransrectal ultrasound (TUS) revealed a homogeneous prostate gland with a volume of 23 cm3. The seminal vesicles were normal in size and had no contents.\nIn view of the persistent symptoms, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was requested. The seminal vesicles were slightly distended, though the signal intensity was normal. On the other hand, dilatation of the venous plexuses was noted, resulting in a congestive appearance of the lesser pelvis, with significant dilatation of the iliac veins and inferior vena cava over its retroperitoneal abdominal trajectory. Considering the MRI findings, we decided to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan extending to the abdomen [Figures -].\nThe CT scan confirmed dilatation of the venous plexuses in the lesser pelvis, with nonpathological contrast uptake in the prostate and seminal vesicles. In addition, we observed symmetrical dilatation of the inferior cava vein, common, internal and external iliac veins, with no sacular venous aneurysms or associated obstructive disease, and the presence of varicosities in the pelvic venous plexuses. On the other hand, at renal sinus level, we observed a preaortic orthotopic left renal vein, with another vein in a retroaortic and prelumbar location, as a variant of normality [].\nBased on the above findings, we referred the patient to the Unit of Vascular Surgery, where treatment with venoactive drugs (diosmin) and lifestyle adaptation measures were recommended reducing pelvic venous pressure by means of avoiding increase intraabdominal pressure (weight lifting) or prolonged standing time at work. The possibility of endovascular embolization/sclerosis in the case of worsening of the symptoms was considered.\nOccasional hemospermia without anemia persists with no other associated symptoms.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n67.749", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 65-year-old man, 163 cm in height and 60 kg in weight, was admitted to the emergency room with a cough, blood tinged sputum and dyspnea. He underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty 15 years earlier due to MS. He had a history of a cerebral infarction and hypertension. Electrocardiography revealed atrial fibrillation (A-Fib). Minimal coronary artery occlusive disease was identified during coronary angiography. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe MS (mitral valve area of 0.79 cm2; mean diastolic pressure gradient of 12.5 mmHg; left atrial volume index [LAVI] of 115 ml/m2), mild tricuspid regurgitation, and a right ventricle systolic pressure of 47 mmHg and ejection fraction (EF) of 72%. Despite mild swirling in the left atrium (LA), no mass or thrombi were observed. The patient was medicated with digoxin, torasemide, simvastatin, and 3 mg of warfarin. For MVR, warfarin was discontinued and heparinization was initiated four days before surgery until midnight of the day before surgery. The international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) one day before surgery were 1.00 and 26.3 seconds, respectively.\nBefore CPB, in TEE, severe spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) in the LA was noted with no evidence of thrombus at any angle (). CPB was instituted and after injecting 18000 units of heparin, the activated clotting time (ACT) was increased to 489 seconds. During CPB, the ACT was maintained at more than 500 seconds with an additional 3000 units of heparin. The body temperature was decreased to 33\u2103. The surgeon confirmed the absence of any removable organized thrombus in the LAA and performed MVR with a Carpentier-Edward 27 valve.\nAfter unclamping the aortic cross clamp (ACC), a well functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve (MV) without paravalvular leakage was confirmed through TEE. The pump flow rate was lowered to wean the patient from CPB and during de-airing of the heart, TEE revealed a newly formed non-mobile mass in the LAA (). At that time, the ACT was 569 seconds. After discussion with the surgeon, a re-bypass was planned, and the mass was removed via a left atriotomy after ACC. The clot was removed as a single piece, which measured approximately 33 \u00d7 33 mm, which had the appearance of a fresh, newly formed thrombus by a visual inspection (). Weaning from the CPB was performed uneventfully. The total CPB and ACC time was 81 minutes and 53 minutes, respectively.\nThe patient awoke six hours after arriving at the intensive care unit with no neurological deficits and was extubated at postoperative day (POD) 1. Anticoagulation was started with warfarin at POD 2. He was transferred to the general ward at POD 3 and discharged at POD 9. His postoperative TTE revealed a well functioning bioprosthetic MV, a slightly decreased LA size with a normal LV function, and no remaining MS or mitral regurgitation.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 53-year-old female presented to our hospital complaining of a 6-month history of backache. Judging from the blood testing results, she had hypercalcemia, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased to 1,253 U/L (normal range, 35 to 130); the patient was sent to the endocrinology department. Her past history was significant for a surgical procedure for fibrocystoma of her right humerus 20 years ago, and she had donated one of her kidneys to a relative 7 years previously. She had taken atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, and omega-3 fatty acid 1,000 mg daily for the past 3 years to treat high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The patient had been misdiagnosed with a thyroid nodule and hypothyroidism at another hospital 4 years previously and had immediately been prescribed levothyroxine 50 \u00b5g/day. At that time, the thyroid ultrasonography revealed two nodules that were 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter on her right lobe and another nodule that was 2.3\u00d71.3 cm in size that was projected backwards. She had fine needle aspiration cytology for the nodule on the left lobe, and this had revealed a benign nodule. She had been followed up every 6 months by neck ultrasonography. Two years later, when the nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid had increased in size to 2.9\u00d71.7 cm, they carried out radiofrequency ablation. However, the thyroid nodule remained the same size even after the radiofrequency ablation, so they monitored its size every 6 months for 2 more years (). During that time, the patient began experiencing backache and visited the orthopedics department of our hospital where she was suspected of having metabolic bone disease due to the high serum ALP value.\nThe patient presented with generalized weakness and fatigue without other hypercalcemic symptoms. The peripheral blood examination was as follows: leukocyte count, 7,020/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL; platelet count, 249,000/mm3; prothrombin time (PT), 14.4 seconds (normal range, 11.9 to 14.3); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 31.3 seconds (normal range, 29.1 to 43.5); serum iron, 65 \u00b5g/dL (normal range, 40 to 160); total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 258 \u00b5g/dL (normal range, 230 to 430); transferrin saturation, 25%; and ferritin, 158.6 ng/mL (normal range, 13 to 150). Serum chemistry values were also obtained: blood urea nitrogen, 26.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.98 mg/dL; glucose, 110 mg/dL; ALP, 1,011 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L. Serum calcium was 14.6 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.5 mg/dL, and ionized calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. Serum protein and serum albumin were 6.9 and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. The results of the serum electrolyte test revealed that sodium was 135.7 mmol/L, potassium was 4.3 mmol/L, chloride was 104.0 mmol/L, and serum osmotic pressure was 286 mOsm/kg. According to the serum lipid examination, the total cholesterol was 146 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein was 33 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein was 79 mg/dL. A thyroid function test found T3 was 108.9 ng/dL (normal range, 80 to 200), thyroid stimulating hormone was 0.40 mIU/L (normal range, 0.27 to 4.2), and free T4 was 0.74 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.70). Under dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-based bone density examination, the T-score of the lumbar region was -1.4, while the T-scores of the neck were -1.2 on the left and -1.8 on the right. Except for the fifth lumbar vertebra, which had spondylolisthesis, nothing remarkable was found on magnetic resonance imaging.\nAccording to further blood tests, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 9.6 ng/mL (normal range, 4.8 to 52.8), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was 10.5 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6 to 54.3), while the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 1,911 pg/mL (normal range, 15 to 65). When we performed bone scanning with 99mTc, the amount of cortical bone radioactive isotope uptake increased very high (). Because we suspected hyperparathyroidism, we carried out a 99mTc sestamibi scan and suspected the lesion that had been previously diagnosed as a left thyroid nodule was likely a parathyroid adenoma (). Using thyroid Doppler ultrasonography, we discovered a hypervascular adenoma that was 5-cm-sized solid mass with similar echo of surrounding thyroid tissue in the center, and slightly low echo in outer part in the inferior site of left thyroid gland (), while on the right thyroid parenchyma we discovered two thyroid nodules, 0.3 and 0.5 cm each in diameter, that the patient had had 4 years before. We performed neck computed tomography and found there was no neck lymph node metastastasis and local invasion of other organs ().\nThe patient received both hydration and diuretic treatments until she underwent a surgical operation to control the hypercalcemia; she also had pamidronate 90 mg intravenous injections twice a week. On the 11th day after hydration and diuretic treatment, her condition had improved; serum calcium was reduced to 11.6 mg/dL, and creatinine improved to 1.11 mg/dL. On the 12th day, the patient had left parathyroid excision and was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (). Following the surgical procedure, iPTH normalized to 42.5 pg/mL, but calcium and vitamin D were prescribed for 9 months to cure the hypocalcemia that had developed due to hungry bone syndrome. It has been a year since the surgical operation, and her calcium, phosphate, ALP, and iPTH all remain at normal levels.\n\nWhat is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 27-year-old Latina woman received a living related transplant from her mother for end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to advanced lupus nephritis and presented with nephrotic range proteinuria 6 months after transplantation.\nThe patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at age of 17. During the course of the disease she fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria including malar rash, arthritis, pericarditis, class IV/V lupus nephritis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and positive antinuclear (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies. The patient's lupus nephritis was treated with glucocorticoids, multiple doses of cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. Despite aggressive treatment, she progressed to ESRD and required renal transplantation. She received a kidney from her mother, which was donor/recipient CMV +/\u2212. The patient has been negative for anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, \u03b22 glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant. The anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA), although reported as positive at one occasion which prompted the use of aspirin for prophylaxis, has been consistently negative ever since. She also has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nThe surgery and hospital course after transplantation were uneventful and the patient was discharged with excellent urine output and creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Six months later she developed nephrotic range proteinuria at 4.6 mg/mg () and her creatinine levels progressively rose to 2.5 mg/dL. However, she lacked edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Her medications at the time included tacrolimus, 4 mg in the morning and 3 mg in the evening, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg bid, prednisone 5 mg/d, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg bid, enalapril 10 mg/d, aspirin 81 mg/d, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 400\u201380 mg/d, valganciclovir HCl 450 mg/d, levothyroxine 0.15 mg/d, and omeprazole 20 mg/d. A kidney biopsy was performed that showed minimal glomerular change by light microscopy and diffuse podocyte foot process effacement by electron microscopy, consistent with MCD (Figures and ). There was no evidence of acute cellular, antibody-mediated, or vascular rejection or immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. In particular, immunofluorescence exam did not reveal significant glomerular staining for IgG, IgA, and C3. There was granular glomerular staining in mesangial regions and capillary loops for 1+ IgM while the tubulointerstitial compartment was negative for immunoglobulins or complement components. Arteries and arterioles stained 1+ for C3 but peritubular capillaries were negative for C3d and C4d. The serum C3 and C4 levels were within the normal range and anti-dsDNA antibody was 1+. Consequently, she received pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone to treat presumed MCD. She did not respond to treatment, while two additional subsequent renal biopsies were also consistent with MCD. In the following 12 months the patient developed several episodes of acute renal failure characterized by increasing proteinuria and creatinine levels that were attributed to dehydration. Her serum albumin levels decreased down to 2.7 g/dL secondary to ongoing protein loss in urine. However, this effect was transient and coincided with one of the peaks of her proteinuria (7.5 g). Otherwise, her albumin during this course usually ranged between 3 and 4 g/dL. Multiple ultrasounds of the kidney were performed. Initially they were normal showing patent renal artery and vein with good perfusion of the transplant on color and power Doppler. However, subsequently the studies exhibited mild hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney and turbulence in the right external iliac vein proximal to the attachment of the transplanted renal vein that was suggestive of narrowing. Eventually, because of worsening proteinuria and creatinine (9.7 mg/mg and 3.4 mg/dL, resp.), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis without contrast was done for further investigation and revealed diminished signal intensity in the right iliac artery. A subsequent angiogram revealed a normal right iliac artery and renal transplant arterial anastomosis but outlined stenosis of the right external iliac vein adjacent to the transplant anastomosis with a pressure gradient of 7 mmHg between the common iliac vein and the external iliac vein. Balloon angioplasty of the right external iliac vein partially corrected the stenosis with a postangioplasty gradient of 2-3 mmHg. A few weeks later recurrent renal dysfunction necessitated a second venogram that showed restenosis and culminated in angioplasty and stent placement with pressure gradient improving from 10 mmHg to 0. After the stent deployment and dilation to 12\u201314 mm in diameter, a thrombus was identified within the stent which was aspirated. There was no thrombus seen prior to stenting which leads to the assumption that this was a procedure-related complication. Subsequently, the patient received one month of renally dosed enoxaparin as prophylaxis to decrease the possibility of in-stent thrombosis. Following the procedure, the proteinuria and creatinine levels steadily declined and reached her baseline of 300 mg/day and 1.5 mg/dL, respectively, at one-year follow-up ().\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n48.68", "task": "calc"}

Results from liver function tests were normal. Her troponin level was 50ng/L (normal range: <30ng/L). Venous blood gas measurements revealed a profound metabolic acidemia: pH, 6.58; partial pressure of CO2, 38.6mmHg; HCO3, 3.6mmol/L; glucose, 2.0mmol/L; and lactate, 16.7mmol/L. Her initial resuscitation strategy included 2000mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate, 15 units insulin (Actrapid) in 50mL 50% dextrose, and 1mL/kg of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution.\nMinutes after these initial investigations, our patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was managed as per advanced life support protocol. She had a total downtime of 25 minutes. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation she was intubated and ventilated. Following return of spontaneous circulation, she required an infusion of adrenaline for blood pressure support. She had an unremarkable chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and toxicology screen.\nWith a presumed diagnosis of ischemic bowel based on vague abdominal features and profound lactatemia, our patient was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for preoperative optimization. In our ICU, she was sedated and ventilated on an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% and on modest ventilator paramters (peak inspiratory pressure <25cmH2O). To treat her severe circulatory shock, she was fluid-resuscitated with a total of 10,000mL crystalloid from a central venous pressure of 8cmH2O to 16cmH2O. In addition, she required very high doses of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was commenced at exchange rates of 50mL/kg/h using Hemosol B0 solution. She was empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam (Tazocin) as broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover.\nOur patient went to theater 26 hours post admission for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed no significant findings. We continued her broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover despite negative microbiological cultures. Renal replacement therapy continued and our patient\u2019s acid-base balance slowly normalized over three days. Having excluded all causes of a high anion gap lactic acidosis, including negative red blood cell transketolase activity for thiamine deficiency, we presumed our patient to have had a severe MALA \u2018triggered\u2019 by an acute kidney injury from dehydration. This was supported by a serum metformin level of 4mg/L.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 41-year-old woman (height 1.66 m; weight 62 kg) with SMA type IV was scheduled for mammectomy. The diagnosis of SMA type IV was based on clinical progressive symptoms of limb muscular weakness that began eight years ago. She has been on wheelchair since five years ago. At present, she even could not lift her arms up but had no difficulty in swallowing or breathing. She had a family history of SMA, her mother (died at 50 years old) and uncle both had the same disease. She had resection of right breast fibroadenoma under local anesthesia 6 years ago and right oophorocystectomy under epidural anesthesia 12 years ago. Physical examination revealed that she had a hoarse throat, normal gape degree, proximal muscular atrophy of the limb, muscular strength 2\u20134 degrees (with 4 degrees in the upper limb and 2 degrees in the lower limb), decreases of tendon reflex in extremities, no pyramidal tract signs, and paraesthesia. Chest X-ray showed increases in lung markings. ECG was normal. The laboratory examinations were normal except serum creatinine 31.00 \u03bcmol/L (normal value is 44\u2013133 \u03bcmol/L). Bronchofiberscopy showed limitation of vocal fold abduction. A size 6 cm \u00d7 6 cm lump (benign fiber-epithelial tumor confirmed by a biopsy pathological examination) was found in her right breast, and at her request, her admission was scheduled to remove her right breast in fear of malignancy in the future.\nOn the operating day, no premedication was given to the patient. Electrocardiogram, cuffed blood pressure, and SpO2 were monitored. External jugular vein was inserted with an 18 ga catheter due to collapse of extremity veins. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (target-controlled infusion at plasma concentration of 3 ng/mL) and propofol (target-controlled infusion at plasma concentration of 3 \u03bcg/mL) and a size 4 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was tried to but failed. Then rocuronium 30 mg was given to facilitate the endotracheal intubation. The patient was intubated with an insertion of a size 7 endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with intravenous remifentanil (target-controlled infusion at plasma level of 2-3 ng/mL), propofol (target-controlled infusion at plasma level of 3-4 \u03bcg/mL), and 50% nitrous oxide balanced with oxygen. The hemodynamic parameters were stable during the one-hour surgery. Morphine 3 mg was given intravenously 30 minutes before the end of operation. The patient woke up quickly after cessation of anesthesia and could raise her head. Antagonists of muscle relaxant (neostigmine 2 mg plus atropine 1 mg) were given. She was extubated and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), where she recovered uneventfully.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 51-year-old man who had been diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer four years earlier had undergone treatment with a subtotal colectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. He had received a craniotomy to excise a brain tumor one month previously. His height was 177 cm and his weight was 73 kg. His current chief complaint was a two-month history of severe back pain, accompanied by a tingling sensation, with radiation of the pain into both inguinal regions, especially the right. The patient's knee jerk reflexes were normal without neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the patient's lumbar spine, at L1, L2, L4, and L5. The main cause of the patient's symptoms was a lesion in L1, which had metastasized to the posterior vertebral body wall and right pedicle, resulting in spinal cord compression (). The patient had received radiation therapy before visiting the pain clinic, and he was taking oxycodone 40 mg and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day with no complications. Despite these interventions, he continued to experience significant pain. The pain was aggravated by changes in position from lying to sitting and relieved when he was lying. He rated his pain as 6\u201310 on the numeric 0\u201310 rating scale (NRS).The patient's average pain score with respect to the NRS was 8/10. However, he did not wish to undergo open surgery because of his poor general condition and short life expectancy. We initially planned to reduce the patient's pain using an epidural block prior to secondary interventional management, but he was not able to tolerate the prone position required to receive the epidural block due to the severe radiating pain he experienced in that position. Therefore, it was necessary to treat the patient's pain maximally in a single therapeutic session. Thus, we proposed to perform BRFD with PVP and the patient agreed to undergo the procedure.\nWe proceeded under conscious sedation administered by an experienced anesthesiologist, because of the patient's poor general condition and in order to prevent neurological complications during the procedure. For analgesia, a 12 \u00b5g fentanyl patch was applied to the patient's right upper thorax twelve hours before the procedure, and an intramuscular injection of pethidine 25 mg was also administered ten minutes before the procedure. One hour before the procedure, the patient received an intramuscular injection of midazolam 3 mg for sedation. During the procedure, the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram were monitored. The patient was placed on an operating table in the prone position with a flexed hip. His skin was prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. The entry point of the needle through the skin was determined using an axial MRI (). The needle was inserted 9 cm lateral to the midline. After a subcutaneous 1% lidocaine injection, a small incision was made with a blade, and under continuous fluoroscopic monitoring, an 18 gauge needle and guidewire were inserted sequentially through the incision site until the tip of the needle reached the middle portion of the L1 pedicle. Then, a dilator was used to insert a 2.7 mm diameter cannula (Disc-FX\u00ae System, Elliquence, LLC, Baldwin, NY, USA) to the middle portion of the pedicle in the lateral view and the medial pedicular margin in the anteroposterior (AP) view. A trephine was inserted through the working channel to the posterior body line in the lateral view and the median vertebral line in the AP view. After removing the guidewire and trephine, a 2.5 mm diameter bipolar probe (Trigger-Flex\u00ae Bipolar System, Elliquence) was inserted through the working channel (). An energy generator (Surgi-Max\u00ae, Elliquence) that emits high radiofrequency and low temperature radiowaves was connected to the Trigger-Flex\u00ae Bipolar probe and we shrank the tumor mass by ablation using the turbo-modulation mode. We also used the bipolar hemo-modulation mode for thermocoagulation to prevent bleeding. We conducted five cycles of the procedure while subtracting from the midline of the vertebral body to the lateral border of the right pedicle at the L1 level. The procedure was repeated using the turbo-modulation mode and the hemo-modulation mode in shifts per five second. Once the radiofrequency ablation procedure was completed, we performed PVP at the L1 and L2 bodies. The bone puncture needles were inserted into the posterior 1/3 aspect of the L1 body and the medial part of the L2 body in the lateral view and the median vertebral line in the AP view through the right pedicle. Two ml of sterile polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) powder (Exolent Spine, Elmdown, Ltd., London, UK) and the liquid components were injected to the L1 and L2 bodies under frequent fluoroscopic lateral and AP views to avoid PMMA leakage into the venous system and the epidural space (). We completed the procedure after confirming via fluoroscope that there was no leakage of cement. The patient's radiating pain disappeared after the procedure, and there were no complications. Following the procedure, the patient's vital signs were monitored and he was observed for any neurological complications for 30 min in the outpatient recovery room, after which he was transferred to the general ward.\nThe patient was discharged the day after the procedure because he reported relief of his pain to a level of 1/10 on the NRS without any complications, and he was able to sit without pain. He was then able to undergo continuous chemotherapy and radiotherapy for treatment of the multiple bone metastases. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient's average pain score with respect to the NRS was 1/10. He could sit and walk in his daily life without the recurrence of radicular pain.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

As aspects of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are based on ability to read and write in English, some components of the MMSE were not possible to assess using phone-translation and were excluded from scoring, as noted below.\nOur initial evaluation was on hospital day 2, with calcium now corrected with medical intervention to 10.2 mg/dL. Our exam was significant for somnolence, unchanged auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, poverty of speech, fluctuation in attention, and poor concentration. The patient was oriented only to person and knew that she was in a hospital. She was guarded with the interviewer, expressing fear that her clinical team would reveal her location to the \u201cpeople trying to get [her].\u201d During her stay, she periodically endorsed suicidal ideation, with two attempts at self-asphyxiation with an IV cord. She also was often found by night staff hiding in her closet from \u201cpeople coming to get [her].\u201d She was diagnosed with delirium due to hypercalcemia, mixed-subtype.\nOur C/L team recommended one-to-one (1 : 1) observation, frequent reorientation, and limiting the use of tethers (e.g., catheters), as well as other environmental maneuvers as part of the hospital's delirium protocol. Her psychosis was treated with olanzapine titrated to 15 mg daily, gabapentin 300 mg daily, and haloperidol 2 mg IM every four hours for agitation that impeded essential medical care. These interventions yielded no significant change in mental status or perceptual disturbances.\nSix days before right hemithyroidectomy, the patient was evaluated by the C/L team with calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL, ionized calcium of 5.2 mg/dL, albumin of 3.5 g/dL, and PTH of 8 pg/dL. Her MMSE was scored 11/22, with some questions deferred due to language barrier. Patient lost points for date, season, and declined to answer location questions or copy a drawing of intersecting pentagons. There was no change in the patient's mental status exam at this time; she continued to have auditory hallucinations of voices stating they were going to \u201ctie a rope around [her] neck.\u201d She also expressed persecutory delusions that these people came to the hospital and tried to enter her room the night before.\nSix days postsurgery, with calcium level of 7.7 mg/dL, albumin of 4.1 g/dL, and PTH of 91 pg/mL, the patient was found to have continued somnolence, fluctuating attention, disorientation to place and time, and a persecutory delusion that she would be \u201carrested.\u201d She denied hallucinations or suicidal ideation at this time. She was found to have an MMSE score of 4/18, losing points for all time and place questions, attention, and 2/3 delayed word recall, again with some questions deferred due to language barrier.\nEleven days postsurgery, with calcium level of 8.8 mg/dL, albumin of 4 g/dL, and PTH of 63 pg/mL, the patient was found to have improved alertness and was oriented to person, hospital, day, month, and year but not to city or state, despite continued treatment with olanzapine, gabapentin, and haloperidol. She denied hallucinations but her persecutory delusion of being \u201carrested\u201d remained, and the patient expressed feeling unsafe in the hospital. The patient exhibited echolalia as well as blunted affect. She continued to have some impairments but showed marked improvement, with MMSE score of 17/30. Points were lost for date, town, county, hospital floor, concentration, phrase repetition, writing a sentence, copying a picture, and 2/3 words remembered on delayed recall.\nThe patient was discharged on postoperative day 13, hospital day 29, to an outside inpatient psychiatric unit for management of continued psychosis with no further improvement of her MMSE. While the patient was no longer in our direct care, she sought sporadic treatment through our hospital system following discharge and some of her course is known. The patient was discharged after 6 days from inpatient psychiatric care with a medication regimen including olanzapine 10 mg and gabapentin 600 mg three times daily and attended one appointment with our outpatient psychiatry office. The patient was lost to follow-up for 4 months until she presented to our hospital again for symptoms of disorientation, drowsiness, and slowed gait. She was then admitted for a second time, 5 months after initial presentation, and was diagnosed with extrapyramidal symptoms from antipsychotic use. She was discharged the next day with symptom resolution on 20 mg propranolol daily. Her olanzapine was discontinued and an appointment with her psychiatrist was made. Unfortunately, our records show that the patient next sought out care again 3 months later, when her family called crisis outreach for bizarre behavior, auditory hallucinations, and persecutory delusions. She was admitted to a nonaffiliate inpatient psychiatric service 8 months after initial presentation, and her current clinical status is unknown.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

In the past medical history, one year before hospitalization, he had the history of low back pain and underwent disk hernia operation in India. Six months after disc hernioraphy, low back pain continued and the patient came back to India for further evaluation. On the second visit and evaluation, the patient\u2019s laboratory tests revealed normal complete blood count (CBC), normal liver and renal function tests. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 15 mm/1st hr. Also the serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum protein, electrophoresis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were normal. At this time, the patient was prescribed six Vitamin D ampoules (300,000 IU), however, the drugstore gave him 60 Vitamin D ampoules. After returning to the country of origin (Afghanistan), he injected 40 Vitamin D ampoules (one vitamin D ampoule each week). During this period of time, the patient had 30 Kg weight loss and then returned to Iran and was admitted in our hospital. Besides weight loss, he also had the complaint of pruritus, nausea and vomiting. Primary evaluation revealed a serum creatinine of 4 mg/dl, serum calcium of 12 mg/dl, serum phosphorus of 3 mg/dl, serum intact PTH of 2.7 ng/ml (normal: 10-65 ng/ml), and vitamin D level of >400 nmol/l (normal: 47.7-144 nmol/l). Also the patient had serum hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dl, hematocrit of 30% and ESR of 55 mm/1st hr. For further evaluation, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed, which were normal. Moreover, the results of serum protein electrophoresis, urine and serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis were normal. The serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and PSA level was normal. PSA as well as skull, chest and pelvic X-rays were normal. To find further information on the renal damage a renal biopsy was also performed. On light microscopy, the glomeruli had normal morphology and architecture (). There was no vasculopathy. The main pathology was found in the tubulointerstitial compartment. The interstitial area harbored significant inflammatory cell infiltration, predominantly mononuclear cells, associated with mild tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Both tubular dilatation and calcified necrotic debris in the tubular lumina were evident. Tubular cell degeneration was also seen (). On immunofluorescence study, there was no deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q or fibrin. The diagnosis was tubulointerstitial nephritis, mostly chronic and compatible with the clinical diagnosis of vitamin D intoxication due to dispensing error. The patient was treated for hypercalcemia. Prednisolone, 1 mg/kg was started and gradually tapered. Serum creatinine and calcium level gradually decreased. However, serum vitamin D level continued to be high, even after one year. The patient returned to his country with serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl and calcium of 10 mg/dl. A low dose prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) was continued. We were updated on his laboratory results regularly. After two years, the last serum creatinine test showed a value of 1.2 mg/dl.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n70.975", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 58-year old Caucasian male with a history of recurrent paroxysmal AF came to the Emergency Department (ED) with the complaint of epistaxis. He had a history of end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. His cardiologist had started him on dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice a day about 4 months ago. He was previously on warfarin, but side effects including multiple episodes of minor epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeds requiring transfusions warranted the switch to dabigatran etexilate. His CHADS2 score was 5, supporting the need for anticoagulation to prevent future stroke events []. Since being started on dabigatran etexilate, he has been tolerating it except for minor epistaxis. On the day of ED presentation, the patient awoke to find himself in a pool of blood. His vital signs were unremarkable on arrival to the hospital. Because of persistent epistaxis, an inflatable balloon epistaxis device was placed in the right nostril in the ED, with good hemostasis. He was admitted to the hospital for monitoring and further work-up.\nAbnormal labs at the time of admission included a prothrombin time (PT) of 63 seconds, INR of 8.8, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 105.7 seconds, and elevated BUN and creatinine of 73 mg/dL and 4.12 mg/dL, respectively. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were frequently checked, and they remained stable around 12 mg/dL and 37 mg/dL, respectively, not requiring any pRBC transfusions. The patient had not missed any dialysis session prior to admission. The supratherapeutic INR was thought to be secondary to dabigatran etexilate, and the medication was held. Other possible causes of supratherapeutic INR were excluded, including Vitamin K deficiency and severe liver disease, as laboratory values showed normal liver function test (LFT), albumin, and Vitamin K levels. He was given fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and ENT was consulted for additional packing. As dabigatran etexilate was a new anticoagulation agent at the time, the hospital did not have a reversal protocol for dabigatran etexilate toxicity in place and thus FFP was used. He remained stable clinically and the INR and aPTT trended downward after holding the dabigatran and continuing his scheduled dialysis session the following day. INR was 1.7 at the time of discharge and his aPTT had normalized. After a 5-day hospital stay, he was discharged. He went home without anticoagulants as his recurrent bleeds were thought to be a substantial morbidity risk outweighing the benefit of stroke prevention.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "output": "### Response:\n0", "task": "calc"}

She was referred to the outpatient clinic of gastroenterology department in a tertiary hospital due to jaundice and increased levels of liver enzyme detected during blood test tracking after 5 weeks of pazopanib therapy.\nThe patient's medical history included end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, liver cirrhosis with hepatitis B virus carrier. The patient underwent right nephrectomy for RCC 2 years ago. Newly onset liver and lung metastasis were detected 3 months ago by liver biopsy. The patient started taking immunotherapy agent (pazopanib) and prophylactic antiviral agent (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) from 2 months ago. Pazopanib prescribe was started at half dose considering the patient's clinical history of liver cirrhosis. After administration at 400 mg per day, which is half the dose for 2 weeks, liver enzyme level was kept in the normal range and showed no change, so the dosage was increased to a fixed amount of 800 mg per day and dosing was maintained for an additional 2 weeks.\nBefore first visiting the outpatient clinic, the patient had symptoms of nausea with vomiting and jaundice for 2 weeks. The patient was suspected to progress acute hepatitis considering jaundice and increased liver enzyme. Elevated serum total bilirubin persisted 2 weeks after pazopanib discontinuation and she was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of admission, she was 160.5 cm tall, weighed 61.1 kg, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 23.72. Blood pressure of the patient was normal with a systolic blood pressure of 123 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 74 mm Hg. Mild elevated body temperature (37.8 \u00b0C) and normal heart rate (95 bpm) with normal breathing rate (18 breaths per minute) was seen. The patient presented with nausea and jaundice. The patient had a soft abdomen on physical examination.\nLiver-function test at baseline shows no abnormal findings measured before pazopanib treatment and 2 weeks after the start of treatment. However, blood tests measured 5 weeks after the start of treatment revealed abnormal findings in liver function. At the time 5 weeks after starting treatment of pazopanib, levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were 306, 427, and 227 U/L, respectively. Prothrombin time-international normalized ratio value was in normal range (0.99). The total bilirubin level was 1.98 mg/dL (Fig. ). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 6.1 ng/mL with in normal range. The blood test results related to hepatitis virus infection are as follows, hepatitis B surface antigen (positive); anti-HBs (negative); hepatitis B e antigen (negative); anti-HBe (positive); hepatitis B virus DNA (120 copies/mL); anti-hepatitis C virus (negative). Child-Pugh score and class were 5 points and class A. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 20 points and estimated 3-month mortality was 19.6%.\nContrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis and there was no significant change of about 1.3 cm sized enhancing hepatic nodule on right lobe which is pathologically proven metastatic RCC. There was no obstructive lesion on biliary tract (Fig. ). Abdominal ultrasound also revealed no significant abnormality other than hepatic nodule and liver cirrhosis.\nThere was a clinical possibility of DILI caused by pazopanib, and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score was used to evaluate the possibility of the disease. The patient was of the mixed type. Symptoms started appearing 5 weeks after administration (+2). Total bilirubin, AST, and ALT were normalized within 180 days of the cessation of drug administration (+2). There were no risk factors such as alcohol, pregnancy, and the elderly over 55 years of age (0). Although tenofovir was taken as a concomitant drug, the possibility of hepatotoxicity by the drug was low, and the time interval was not consistent with the onset of symptoms (0). There were no acute viral hepatitis, bile duct obstruction, alcoholism, or recent hypotension that could cause liver damage other than drugs (+2). Pazopanib, which was taken, is a drug with a warning of hepatotoxicity on the product according to previous studies (+2). The possibility of DILI can be known more clearly through re-administration of the drug, but re-administration was not performed in this patient (0). Taking these factors into consideration, the patient's RUCAM score was 8 points, and it was in the probable group corresponding to 6 to 8 points, so the possibility of DILI was high. At the beginning of the clinical course, it was unknown whether there will be any improvement after the cessation of drug administration, so even if this score factor (course-change after stopping drug) was excluded, the RUCAM score was already 6 points, indicating a high possibility of DILI, so treatment for pazopanib-induced DILI was initiated.\nFinally, for confirmatory diagnosis, liver biopsy was performed to establish the cause of jaundice. Liver biopsy revealed hepatocyte swelling and degeneration with cholestasis in centrilobular area and the protal tract showed only sparse chronic inflammation. The final diagnosis was confirmed as acute cholestatic hepatitis consistent with toxic hepatitis (Fig. ). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with severe DILI due to pazopanib.\nThe patient started to take prednisolone 40 mg daily for 1 week for empirical treatment of DILI. The dose of prednisolone was gradually reduced every 1 week and it was discontinued finally after 7 weeks of dosing. After discontinuation of pazopanib and taking empirical steroid treatment, the patient's AST and ALT levels were maintained within the normal range and total bilirubin level was decreased significantly from the peak level of 24.61 to 1.06 mg/dL on 12-weeks after pazopanib discontinuation (Fig. ). After discontinuation of pazopanib treatment, jaundice improved rapidly and the patient is currently being observed in the outpatient clinic.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.

She reported that her symptoms started immediately post-procedure and that she continued to have multiple episodes of mostly clear vomit with streaks of blood. She also reported throat, chest, and epigastric pain and was unable to eat anything since the procedure due to her symptoms.\nHer past medical history included hypertension, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, variceal hemorrhage, gall stones and Graves disease. She was on propranolol, lactulose, alprazolam and amlodipine at home. Social history was significant for heavy alcohol use for over 30 years, which she quit following an episode of variceal bleeding. She had no episodes of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding since her last EGD and banding. On physical examination, she was an ill-appearing female, had dry oral mucosa, tachycardic, had epigastric and RUQ tenderness with negative Murphy's sign, and no rebound or guarding. During the interview, she vomited small amounts of non-bloody white material several times.\nOn presentation, her laboratory tests were as follows: WBC 13.1, Hb/Hct 14/39.7, platelets 260; Na 152, K 3.6, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 30, Cr 0.87, glc 146; lipase 93, Alk Phos 113, AST/ALT 48/75, lactic acid 2.0 and drug screen was positive for propofol.\nThe patient was admitted for dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. She was started on IV fluids, anti-emetics, pain control and kept NPO (nothing by mouth). Her dyselectrolytemia improved following hydration and her diet was advanced on the following day. She could not tolerate oral intake and reported worsening dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Over the course of next 2 days, the patient continued to have worsening dysphagia with no relief from anti-emetics. A barium swallow was administered which showed a complete obstruction of the distal esophagus (). The differential for obstruction was thought to be either from local edema from the banding procedure, impacted food or a hematoma from the procedure. An EGD was performed; the scope was advanced to 34 cm to the level of obstruction and it was noted to have a band with entrapped varix in the center of the lumen surrounded by fibrotic material closing off the rest of the lumen (). Several attempts were made with biopsy forceps to reopen the lumen that resulted in a small amount of bleeding and the scope was removed at this point. Conservative management of the patient continued, i.e., NPO with intravenous hydration and pain control. Her symptoms improved over the course of the next 3\u20134 days and she started tolerating diet advancement and was subsequently discharged.\nShe presented the next day with a recurrence of similar symptoms, i.e., dysphagia, abdominal pain and vomiting. A repeat barium swallow showed patency of the esophagus with a parallel channel that retained contrast much later than the initial swallow, suggestive of an esophageal tear with an intramural dissection of 6 cm to the level of gastro-esophageal junction ().\nThe patient was kept NPO with peripheral parenteral nutrition and close monitoring for possible esopheageal perforation. Over the course of the next several days, the diet was carefully advanced with inputs from gastroenterologist and surgical consultants. After 5 days, the patient reported much improvement in her symptoms and was able to tolerate a full diet for the first time.\nA repeat barium swallow was obtained prior to discharge that showed no obstruction or dissection.

Cardiac ultrasound set the question of aortic dilatation with the possible presence of hematoma in the aortic wall or a small intimal flap in the proximal ascending aorta. Although there was an intact aortic and mitral valve function. No pericardial effusion was noted. A chest computerized tomography showed the presence of an ascending aortic aneurysm at 6 cm and a circumferential aortic tear with the possible presence of an intimal tear in the ascending aorta as well (Figure ).\nThe patient was emergently operated. We performed ascending aortic replacement under the support of cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia. Intraoperatively a complete circumferential aortic tear was noted just above the sinotubular junction. The entry and exit point of the dissection were confined in the ascending aorta. Ascending aorta was replaced with a 26 Dacron graft. The patient recovered well and discharged on seventh postoperative day. Pathology revealed no specific findings in the resected aortic segment.

He had a story of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia under statin therapy, type II diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycaemic therapy, and he was a smoker in the past. He referred previous saphenectomy and haemorrhoidectomy operations, no other comorbidities.\nHe reported, for several days, the appearance of episodes of chest pain in the back that occur at rest for about five to ten minutes each\nThe first ECG showed sinus rhythm with ST segment depression in leads V2-V6, not evident at the repeated ECGs done in the absence of chest pain.\nRepeated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB fraction and Troponin I) were slightly elevated with a typical trend (peak values CK-MB 23,7 ng/dl; Troponin I 4,83 ng/dl).\nEchocardiographic (ECO) evaluation showed good right and left ventricular global function with ipo-akinesia of postero-lateral medium-basal wall. Non valvular diseases.\nAfter the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) non-ST-Segment Elevation the patient was admitted to hospital for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease and began a pharmacological anti-ischemic therapy complete with Ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose e, second ischemic and bleeding risks, fondaparinux (2.5 mg sc per day).\nTwenty hours from hospital admission, the patient was referred to the haemodynamic laboratory and a coronarography was performed via right radial artery approach. Angiography revealed small left anterior descending with diffused luminal irregularities, not significant stenosis, intermediate artery of small calibre, with 99% proximal stenosis; normal Circumflex artery; right coronary artery, dominant, without stenosis.\nIn view of this and in agreement with the patient, it was decided to attempt interventional revascularization and stenting of the intermediate artery. An Ipercoat run-through guide wire was chosen for revascularization.\nPre-dilatation with Maverick 2 x 20 mm (8 ATM) balloon was done and the artery was stented with Supraflex 2 x 16 mm (14 ATM).\nFinally post-dilation with Hiryu 2,25 x 10 mm balloon was done.\nAngiography after wire retraction demonstrated a small depot of contrast evolving around the stented vessel segment, referred to coronary perforation of distal tract of third branch of intermediate artery.\nThe operator decided to achieve the haemostasis by sealing the coronary artery perforation with repeated balloon inflations lasting 5 minutes for each one. Administration of protamine for heparin neutralization, was prescribed. A later angiographic control displayed disappearance of images related to perforation, TIMI 3 flow.\nECG did n\u2019t shows new ischemic changes\nAn echocardiography exam showed slight, stable, pericardial effusion.\nDue to stable haemodynamic condition the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit, but the following hours the patient had a sudden haemodynamic evolution with a drop of blood pressure and increase of heart rate. An echocardiography exam revealed a severe pericardial effusion with compression of the right ventricle.\nThis situation was initially managed with rapid volume supply and vasopressor to maintain sufficient end-diastolic right atrial and ventricular pressure.\nDuring the pericardiocentesis, sudden cardiac arrest occurred due to asystole, which required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ACLS protocol was performed for 15 minutes, with the administration of Epinephrine 3 mg which involved ROSC.\nPericardiocentesis, by a subxyphoid approach, was then performed emergently at patient\u2019s bed and 500 ml of blood was removed from the pericardial space. Echocardiography was repeated 10 minutes later, having found a new pericardial effusion despite pericardial drainage. Due to persistent haemorrhage and progressive hemodynamic collapse an urgent surgery management was required .The pericardium was opened via median sternotomy and a significant amount of clot and blood was removed (about 1,5 L) with immediate hemodynamic benefit. Exploration showed an intramural ventricular haematoma of the inferior-lateral wall (site of coronary perforation) of the left ventricle with parietal haemorrhagic infarction.\nExtracorporeal circulation (CEC) and cardioplegic arrest with ante-grade hot blood cardioplegia was done.\nA composite Dacron with autologous pericardium patch (Resorcinol-Formol type glue) was used for left ventricular free wall rupture repair and the geometry of the left ventricle was restored. Subsequently aorta was declamped; the patient was weaned from CEC with a good haemodynamic recovery.\nThe postoperative evolution was characterized by bilateral decline of visual acuity. Angio-CT cerebri was negative for alteration of intracranial vessels. Retinal fluoroangiography and computerized optical tomography (OCT) were also negative for retinal ischemia and other alterations. Encephalic RMN didn\u2019t detect significant changes. In the following days the patient showed progressive improvement and slow recovery of visual capacity.

Brain computed tomography (CT) showed an intraparenchymal left cerebellar hemorrhage with massive subarachnoid extension, probably due to a vascular malformation. The first electrocardiogram (ECG) recording in the emergency room showed sinus rhythm with abnormal repolarisation in lateral leads (). Troponin-I (Tn-I) values and chest X-ray were normal on admission. The patient underwent immediate surgery for hematoma evacuation and ventricular drainage.\nOne day after admission, we observed increasing oxygen requirements and chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema. The ECG at this time was unchanged and serum Tn-I concentration increased till a peak value of 8.25 ng/mL (<0.08 ng/mL). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular internal dimensions but depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (25%). LV mid and basal segments were severely hypokinetic, whereas apical segments were hypercontractile ( and movie clip 1). The right ventricular size and systolic function, as well as valves, were normal. Nonetheless, the patient did not require hemodynamic support and did not receive catecholamines.\nSystolic function steadily improved over the two following days, along with oxygenation parameters and chest X-ray.

The family had no consanguinity and no specific remarkable family history of seizure, delayed development, hypotonia, or language delay. His 24-month-old younger brother was healthy.\nThe patient was transferred from a local clinic for the evaluation of heart murmur at 9 days of life. At that time, a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 4.2 mm in size, a small secundum atrial septal defect, and a small apical muscular ventricular septal defect were detected by Doppler echocardiography. The patient weighed 3.3 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 53.1 cm (10th\u201325th percentile). During the follow-up, he still showed poor weight gain and a short stature, with microcephaly. At the age of 14 months, he weighed 7.4 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 75.9 cm (10th\u201325th percentile) and a 43.8 cm head circumference (less than 3rd percentile). PDA ligation was done at the age of 4 months. According to the parents, the patient had a delayed gross motor milestone from head control. The Bayley study performed at the age of 6 and 24 months showed a significant delay in both the motor and mental aspects, respectively. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was done at the age of 5 months showed mild ventriculomegaly in the left lateral ventricle, and an arachnoid cyst ().\nWhen the patient was 5 years and 3 months old, he was admitted to the hospital due to afebrile generalized seizure. Before the admission, he had had recurrent febrile seizures since he was 12 months of age, with a frequency of 2 to 4 times per year, with a semiology of ocular deviation to the upward and generalized tonic-clonic type lasting for 30\u201360 seconds. During the patient's hospital stay, brain imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) were done (, ). The interictal EEG showed moderate abnormality with intermittent bifrontal sharp waves, which were sometimes generalized (). As the baby's mother refused antiepileptic drugs medication, the natural course was observed without medication. At that time, the patient still showed severe global developmental delay, remarkable hypotonia, a short stature, and dysmorphic features such as microcephaly; small, low-set ears; dark, straight eyebrows; deep-set eyes; flat nasal bridge; midface hypoplasia; and a small, pointed chin (). The previous diagnostic work-up done at other hospitals, including the conventional chromosomal analysis, revealed no definite causes. As such, array-CGH analysis was done. The patient was rebrought to the hospital for the recurrence of seizure. An antiepileptic drug (valproic acid) was started at age 5 years and 11 months. The array-CGH analysis showed 1p36 deletion syndrome with a 9.15-Mb copy loss of the 1p36.33-1p36.22 region (). The FISH analysis confirmed the diagnosis (). At age 6 years and 10 months, the patient's developmental milestone showed 12 months of gross motor development, a 15-month fine motor status, an 18-month personal-social age, 18 months of language development, and a 16-month cognitive-adaptive status.

The patient had a history of diabetes and hypertension and was on medications. The patient had no history of prior surgery. Preoperative evaluations including laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography was normal. The patient was transferred to the operating room with endotracheal intubation because of an unstable airway caused by sublingual and submandibular swelling. The surgeon, however, opted for nasal intubation of the ETT during the mandibular surgery.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and intravenous injection of 60 mg rocuronium, with a standard monitoring. After the induction of anesthesia, we tried direct laryngoscopy with a conventional Macintosh blade and FOB to change the tube but failed because of massive airway edema and bleeding. The tube exchange procedure was then postponed and the surgical procedure was performed under oral intubation. The open reduction and internal fixation of the mandible was performed successfully within an operating time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The surgeon again opted for a change to nasal intubation for arch bar wiring. An attempt to intubate the patient via the nasal route using FOB, was made. We inserted a 6.5-mm Polar\u2122 Preformed Tracheal Tube via left nostril and tried to intubate the trachea under the guidance of the FOB. However, bleeding and secretions blocked the FOB view despite repeated suctioning as in the first trial. Next, we attempted to use a C-MAC\u00ae video laryngoscope which showed a clear view of the glottis; the FOB view was blurred with secretions and blood. Using a C-MAC\u00ae video laryngoscope we guided the FOB into the trachea. After confirmation of the tracheal ring on the FOB view, we removed the oral ETT and followed with the railroading of the nasal ETT via the FOB.

The patient was awake, alert, and fully oriented. Physical examination revealed signs of pallor and an absence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, bone tenderness or jaundice. Examination of the rectum revealed a few external hemorrhoids, but there was no blood or melena in the rectal vault; there were no skin tags, fissures or palpable masses.\nThe initial laboratory findings showed low hemoglobin levels (7 g/dL), a white blood cell count of 11250 per mm3, a platelet count of 221000 per mm3 and a C-reactive protein of 1.31 mg/dL. Two pints of packed red blood cells were therefore transfused and the patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department.

He had returned to work following 2 weeks of isolation, but had difficulty coping due to exertional dyspnoea. Pulse oximetry demonstrated oxygen desaturation to 85%, particularly whilst wearing an N95 mask. His blood pressure (122/76 mmHg) and heart rate (76 beats/min) remained normal. There were no clinically relevant findings other than a body mass index of 25.3 kg/m2. He had poor effort tolerance on a 6-min walk test, managing a distance of only 120 m.\nThe following differential diagnoses were considered: pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and myocarditis. Chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal ( and ). Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 4.80x 109/l (normal 3.92\u201310.4) with a normal differential count, C-reactive protein 5 mg/l (normal < 10 mg/l), ferritin 267 \u03bcg/l (normal 30\u2013400 ug/l), D-dimer < 0.10 mg/l (0.0\u20130.25 mg/l) and NT-proBNP of 143 ng/l (normal < 300 ng/l). However, his high sensitivity Troponin T level was elevated at 319 ng/l (normal < 14 ng/l) and showed a steady rise to 490 ng/l. His transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) contractility and no regional wall motion abnormality or myocardial hypertrophy. There was no pericardial effusion. The pulmonary arteries were of normal size. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was normal (). The coronary arteries were normal. Based on the clinical findings, rising troponin-T levels, and new T wave inversion in lead III on a repeat 12-lead ECG, a diagnosis of likely COVID-19-related viral myocarditis was made. Treatment with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily and prednisone 40 mg once daily were initiated whilst awaiting a CMR scan.\nThe CMR scan confirmed normal LV and RV function and wall thickness with an LV ejection fraction of 65%, RV ejection fraction of 56% and wall thickness at end-diastole of 7 mm. There was delayed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) within the mid-wall as well as the epicardial regions involving the LV basal inferolateral wall, mid-anterolateral and mid- inferolateral wall ().

Past medical history was insignificant except for miscarriage and there was no history of hypertension before and during pregnancy period. Physical examination revealed weak femoral pulses and brachiofemoral delay. Right and left arm, and leg blood pressures were 190/110 mmHg, 140/90 mmHg, and 80/50 mmHg, respectively. A grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard over the precordial and interscapular areas.\nThe electrocardiogram was normal. Rib notching was evident on chest radiography. Standard and Doppler echocardiographic findings were normally functioning bicuspid aortic valve, abnormal mitral valve with congenital elongation, coarctation of descending aorta with a measured maximum gradient of 93 mmHg across the coarctation and mild sized PDA (Figure ). Thorax CT angiography showed a strict aortic coarctation in proximal part of descending aorta, a small sized PDA, and widening and tortuosity in intercostal arteries (Figure ). The measured coarctation length was 12 mm, isthmus was 19 mm, smallest diameter of aortic coarctation was 5 mm, and postcoarctation aortic diameter was 21 mm.\nCardiac catheterization was performed under general anesthesia and right femoral artery and left femoral vein cannulated. The coarctation segment could not be crossed with 0.035 diagnostic guide wire. Therefore, we used the 0.014 hydrophilic guide wire for crossing the coarctation segment. Diagnostic multiple pores and pigtail catheter were passed across the coarctation over the hydrophilic guide wire. Measurements of aorta and coarctation segment were similar with the CT angiography. The maximal gradient across the coarctation was 102 mmHg and Qp/Qs: 1.2/1. Arcus aorta, ascending aorta and aortic branches were normal in anatomy but ascending aorta was minimally dilated (39 mm; Figure ).\nPigtail catheter was changed to a 14F, 75 cm long Mullins sheath over the 0.035 exchange guide wire. A custom-made eight-zig, 45 mm long CP covered stent (NuMed, Hopkinton, NY) loaded on a BIB balloon (inner balloon 12 mm \u00d7 9 mm, outer balloon 22 mm \u00d7 4 cm) was used. After attachment, the excess covering material is folded around the stent. The graft stent and balloon assembly was passed through the sheath, after checking for correct positioning. Firstly, the inner balloon was inflated and the position was rechecked by angiography and then the outer balloon was inflated fully (Figure ). Both balloons were then deflated, with the inner one being deflated first before being withdrawn through the sheath. Control aortography showed that stent-graft in position covering the coarctation segment and complete occlusion of the patent ductus arteriosus was achieved without any complication. Maximum gradient across the coarctation was measured as 30 mmHg. Therefore, stent-graft was over dilated using high-pressure balloon (22 mm \u00d7 4 cm, NuMed, Hopkinton, NY). The gradient across the coarctation was decreased and measured as 0 mmHg (Figure ). The coarctation segment of aorta was increased from 6 mm to 19 mm. The procedure was completed without complication.\nAfter the procedure, patient was monitored for 48 hours for possible complications and blood pressure control. Blood pressure was returned to normal limits as were the discrepancy between arm and legs. No anti-hypertensive medication was needed after the procedure and the patient was discharged with 300 mg acetyl salicylate.

On physical examination, he was fully conscious with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats/min and temperature of 37\u00b0C. His bowel sounds were normoactive on auscultation. There were no remarkable findings on abdominal palpation, except for a non-tender, large left inguinal hernia with extension to his scrotum. Other related examinations, including a digital rectal examination, were normal. A urine analysis showed pH 5, with 10 to 15 RBCs per HPF, 10 white blood cells per HPF, with rare bacteria and yeast. A urine culture was negative.\nGenitourinary ultrasonography reported a grade 2 hydroureteronephrosis on his left side. An intravenous pyelogram also revealed left hydroureteronephrosis associated with an ill-defined filling defect on the left side of his urinary bladder (Figure ). In order to rule out any intravesical lesion, a cystoscopy was performed that showed a bulging on the left side of his bladder wall due to extravesical pressure. The mucosal lining of his bladder was normal. Intravenous and oral contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (spiral multislice thin section scan) showed an entrapped sigmoid colon that was herniated through his left inguinal canal. Anteromedial displacement of his bladder and left ureter were also evident due to the pressure of his sigmoid colon. His left ureter was dilated due to distal obstruction (Figure ).\nA diagnosis was made of a large inguinal hernia with pressure effects on the urinary system, resulting in hematuria and obstructive hydroureteronephrosis;the abdominal wall was thus opened with a classic inguinal incision. The contents of his hernial sac, including his sigmoid colon and its mesentery, were adhered to the surrounding tissues. An attempt to reduce the content of his hernial sac was unsuccessful, so a low midline incision was made for better exposure and reduction. There was no intra-abdominal mass. A redundant sigmoid colon was found fixed at the internal ring due to severe and chronic adhesion. His proximal sigmoid colon had compressed his bladder and distal ureter at the vesicoureteral junction. After reduction of his hernial sac content, our patient underwent a successful hernia repair with mesh, leading to a quick and uneventful postoperative recovery.\nOur patient's signs and symptoms subsided following surgery. On a postoperative cystogram, all signs had disappeared (Figure ). Our patient was initially followed-up with monthly visits for the next six months, and then every six months.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe patient was a 24-year-old male who experienced difficulty in walking for three months prior to our examination, and complained of dysarthria as well as diplopia. In his personal history, he had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery in the department of surgery seven months prior to our examination. At that time, he was in a state of morbid obesity, and he was 190 cm tall, weighed 170 kg, and had a 47.1 kg/cm2 body mass index (BMI). The patient had hypertension and diabetes mellitus for one year before surgery, but no medical history of alcohol addiction, hepatitis, or tuberculosis. After the initial surgery, he had to undergo additional surgery twice due to leakage of gastroesophageal anastomosis. However, the leakage was continuous, so total parenteral nutrition was given for approximately 60 days. Stent insertion was then performed to begin parenteral nutrition. Subsequently, the patient exhibited a confused mental state and symptoms of delirium. The severity of the symptoms was weak, and his general condition gradually improved even with conservative treatment. The symptoms of delirium were considered temporary symptoms that often appear after an operation. Therefore, the patient left the hospital.\nIn the physical examination that was performed when the patient was admitted to the hospital, he presented with alert consciousness without a sign of cognitive deficiency. At that time, his weight was 110 kg, which was 60 kg lighter than before the operation, and his BMI was 30.5 kg/cm2. Judging from these data, his morbid obesity was remarkably improved. Sensory examination was normal both for superficial and deep sensation. However, as a result of a Medical Research Council of Great Britain (MRC) examination, it was found that the muscle strength of both arms and legs appeared to be at a level of 4-4+/5, showing slight muscle weakness. Dysmetria was observed in both hands and feet, which was more serious on the left side of his body compared to the right side. It was impossible for the patient to sit down, stand, or walk independently due to weakness and dysmetria. In addition, he needed assistance in most aspects of the functional evaluation of the activities for daily living. In particular, he showed serious restrictions of delicate actions such as those required for writing a letter. Furthermore, he showed severe dysarthria, and consequently was diagnosed with severe ataxic dysarthria in a speech evaluation. However, signs of dysphagia were not clinically observed, and the patient had normal findings in a video-fluoroscopic swallowing study as well. He complained of diplopia, but there was no restriction of extraocular movement. Left and right horizontal nystagmus was observed in the horizontal gaze, while there was no up and down vertical nystagmus in the upward gaze.\nThiamine levels slightly reduced to 15 nmol/L (20-50 nmol/L) in a blood test. HbA1C (Hemoglobin A1C) was 5.8%, blood sugar levels two hours after a meal were 208 mg/dl, and blood sugar levels with an empty stomach increased to 126 mg/dl. There were no other abnormal findings in the blood test. No specific lesion was observed on magnetic resonance images or angiography that could explain the symptoms (), and the nerve conduction study (NCS), needle electromyography, and somatosensory evoked potentials study were normal.\nAlthough normal findings were seen with neuroimaging and blood tests, the patient showed typical signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy, including ataxia, nystagmus, and diplopia. Furthermore, because he had a medical history of gastrectomy and long-term total parenteral nutrition, we began to administer thiamine immediately. Intravenous 100 mg/day thiamine was administered for 10 days, and then changed to oral administration. One to two days after the start of intravenous administration of thiamine, the patient could stand by himself. One week later, diplopia and nystagmus disappeared, and he could walk a short distance with minimal assistance. After the eighth day of being hospitalized, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy were carried out in the department of rehabilitation medicine. As a result, the muscle strength of his limbs and the fine movement of both hands gradually improved. On the tenth day, the muscle strength of the patient's limbs fully recovered to the normal range, and he could do most activities of daily living (ADL) without assistance. On the 30th day after being hospitalized, there remained a slight crawling movement when he walked by himself. Nonetheless, his endurance improved enough to walk more than 20 minutes at a speed of 2.5 km/hour on a treadmill. In addition, handwriting became almost normal. With continuous speech therapy, ataxic dysarthria also improved to a slight case from a serious case. Finally, he was discharged from the hospital.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n94.428", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 36-year-old man was admitted to Shonan Kamakura General Hospital because of heart failure, lung edema, and a severely elevated blood pressure (BP) of 224/116 mmHg. Although he had a multiyear history of hypertension, sufficient BP control was not achieved until admission. His serum creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL 10 months before admission.\nLaboratory tests showed serum creatinine of 7.56 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 1366 U/L, and hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL. Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes. An abnormal signal in the cerebrum in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and Keith-Wagener stage IV retinopathy were also noted. Kidney biopsy revealed severe narrowing or occlusion of small arteries with severe endothelial damage as well as shrunken glomeruli and interstitial cell infiltration (Figure ). Compared with normotensive normal kidney tissue that showed isometric nuclei of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) forming an orderly line (Figure ), varying sized EC nuclei were prominent, and there were fewer nuclei within the arterioles in the patient (Figure ), indicating severe vascular EC damage due to severely elevated blood pressure. Based on the above findings, we diagnosed this patient's AKI as acute with chronic ischemic renal damage due to refractory hypertension with microangiopathic hemolysis. He was intensively treated by intermittent hemodialysis, and his heart failure and accompanying pulmonary congestion gradually improved.\nAlthough BP control by nicaldipine and olmesartan allowed hemodialysis withdrawal after six treatment sessions, the serum creatinine level remained high. After written informed patient consent, we performed autologous CD34-positive cell transplantation for AKI. This was the first case in a phase I/II clinical trial of autologous G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood CD34-positive cell transplantation for severe AKI with a CD34-positive cell dose-escalating protocol (trial number jRCTb030190231) to evaluate the safety and efficacy as primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. In this trial, three doses (into one renal artery) were set: low dose (5 \u00d7 105/kg body weight), middle dose (1 \u00d7 106/kg body weight), and high dose (2 \u00d7 106/kg body weight) for three patients in each group. After safety was confirmed, the dose of CD34-positive cells was increased to the next higher dose. The low starting dose (5 \u00d7 105/kg body weight, ie, 1 \u00d7 106/kg body weight, bilateral renal arteries) was based on a consideration of safety in previous reports that used CD34-positive cells for other diseases, including critical limb ischemia and liver cirrhosis. This dose-escalating protocol was approved by the special committee for class 2 regenerative medicine certified by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan (SKRM-2-003). After 800 \u03bcg/d (400 \u03bcg/m2 body surface area) of G-CSF treatment for 5 consecutive days, leukapheresis (COMTEC, Fresenius Kabi Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) was performed to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cells on day 5. Magnetic separation of CD34-positive cells using a CliniMACS instrument was performed on day 6 using anti-CD34 antibody-labeled magnetic nanobeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Immediately after CD34-positive cells were separated and the viability (98.1%) and purity (95.6%) of collected cells were confirmed, 90 million CD34-positive cells were dissolved in 100 mL saline. A guiding catheter was placed in either renal artery through right femoral artery by an interventional radiologist. Cells were directly administered into each renal artery (45 million CD34-positive cells in 50 mL saline) at a rate of 150 mL/h (90 million CD34-positive cells in total) using a syringe driver.\nThe patient's general condition was unremarkable except for a transient elevation in body temperature to 38.1\u00b0C 5 days after transplantation. Platelet count and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 transiently increased during the early post-treatment course (Table ). The patient was discharged to home 10 days after cell transplantation.\nTwenty-three weeks after cell therapy, his serum creatinine level was 2.96 mg/dL.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 18-year-old man (175 cm, 81 kg) with right hemifacial microsomia was scheduled for double-jaw surgery, correction with distraction osteogenesis, and mandibular anglectomy. Although he had no underlying medical history, he had undergone correction with distraction osteogenesis in 2006. At that time, the patient was classified as Cormack-Lehane grade 4, and oral intubation was performed with FOB. The patient reported a history of sleep apnea and heavy snoring, during the preoperative interview. His mouth opening was about 2.5-finger-breadth and neck extension was normal, during the preoperative physical examination. However, he had severe retrognathia and a class III Mallampati score. The thyromental distance was less than 6 cm. Moreover, an oral panoramic view X-ray showed narrowing of the nasopharyngeal airway, due to severe retrognathia (). According to El-Anwar et al. [], the mean depth (anteroposterior diameter) of the nasopharynx in normal adults is 21.8 \u00b1 4.6 mm. However, the depth of nasopharynx in our patient was 15.5 mm, which was narrower than usual. We explained the possibility of a difficult airway and informed the patient about the special risks and procedures pertaining to performing an awake intubation procedure. Other preoperative laboratory examinations, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the day of surgery, we prepared a Glidescope\u00ae; LMA, fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus Optical, Japan); a 0.035-inch-thick, 145-cm-long straight-tipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care, ); and a high-flow nasal cannula (Optiflow\u2122). Nasotracheal intubation was required to secure space in the oral cavity for surgery; thus, we prepared nasotracheal tubes of various sizes. Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) measurement were performed in the operating room. The monitor showed an initial blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, a heart rate of 58 beats/min and room air saturation of 98%. Lidocaine 4% was sprayed onto the tongue and oropharynx for topical anesthesia. Sufficient preoxygenation was provided with Optiflow\u2122, at a flow rate of 20 L/min, to achieve an SpO2 of 100%. We started total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with 2% propofol and remifentanil administered at effect-site concentrations of 2.5 \u00b5g/ml and 1.5 ng/ml, respectively, with a target-controlled infusion pump. The SpO2 decreased to 96%, soon after the BIS was 42 and the patient fell asleep, but there was no further desaturation, after we raised the flow rate of Optiflow\u2122 to 40 L/min. Since the left nostril was larger than the right nostril, owing to right-sided hemifacial microsomia, we decided to insert the FOB into the left nostril. After guiding the FOB into the left nostril of the patient, it passed into the trachea through the glottis, without any issue. We inserted the 145-cm-long, straight-tipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care) into the working channel of the FOB, till we could visualize the entrance of the guidewire into the carina (). We carefully removed the FOB and the guidewire remained in position. We also used the Glidescope\u00ae to confirm that the guidewire was still within the oral cavity and had passed through the vocal cord, and into the trachea (). The exchange catheter (1.6-mm internal diameter [ID], 2.7-mm outer diameter, CAEC, Cook Critical Care) was inserted over the Angio Guidewire and the Angio Guidewire was pulled out. A nasotracheal tube with 6.5 mm ID was advanced carefully over the exchange catheter into the airway without incidence. After removing the exchange catheter, the tracheal tube cuff was inflated, and proper positioning of the ETT was confirmed by auscultating both lungs and by confirming continuous positive end-tidal CO2. The monitor showed a blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats/min, an SpO2 of 97%, and a BIS of 50 after intubation. An oxygenation level of 97% or higher was maintained throughout the procedure. After confirming proper intubation, we adjusted the effect-site concentration of propofol and remifentanil to 4.0 \u00b5g/ml and 2.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, and administered 80 mg of rocuronium intravenously. The time required for the administration of intubation to its confirmation was 16 min.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 10-year-old African American girl was admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of fever and abnormal movements.\nThe patient is a previously healthy, a 10-year-old girl who two weeks prior to admission started having episodes of headache on and off controlled with Tylenol. Headache was generalized, not associated with nausea or vomiting. Three days prior to admission, the patient had low grade fevers, and mom noticed some abnormal movements of the extremities which progressed over the next 2 days to the point where she cannot eat or dress on her own. She also had difficulty in walking and holding on to objects. H/o lip smacking and slurred speech are present for the past 3 days. H/o rash in the lower extremities which looked like hives is present for the past 2 days.\nH/o decreased appetite with loss of weight is present. The day prior to admission the patient had fevers with temperature up to 101 F, and with progression of involuntary movements the patient was taken to her PCP who started her on Acyclovir. With the symptoms getting worser, the patient was taken to an emergency center that evening before being transferred to our hospital for further care and management.\nNo H/o any prior hospitalization. Past H/o sore throat about a month ago which lasted for 2 days. At that time the child did not receive any medical attention, and sore throat went away on its own.\nThe child was adopted, and not much is known about the birth and family history. As per adoptive parents biological mom might have been worked up for some autoimmune diseases, the specificity of which is unknown.\nOn admission, the patient had a temperature of 99.5 F, weight of 55.5 kg (lost 10 pounds over the past 2 to 3 weeks), blood pressure of 99/77, heart rate of 129, and respiratory rate of 20.\nOn Neurological exam, the patient was awake, alert and cooperative. Involuntary lip smacking with tongue protrusion and slurred speech were present. Pronounced choreoathetoid movements of the upper and lower extremities were present. Milkmaid grip was positive. With arms outstretched above the head noticeable chorea with pronation of forearm was present.\nOn Motor exam Tone and reflexes were equal and normal in all 4 limbs. Strength was decreased in the lower extremities and choreiform movements were present.\nSensation was intact. She had trouble with walking without support.\nShe had a diffuse macular rash involving the lower extremities which is erythematous and confluent in some areas. The rest of her physical exam including her thyroid, cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal exam was normal.\nLab values from the outlying ER include a CBC which showed anemia with a Hb of 10.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.5%, MCV of 76.5, and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 89000/mm3. CT scan and a spinal tap were done which were essentially normal. CSF studies showed no pleocytosis with normal protein and glucose. A gram stain of the CSF was negative. Bacterial culture and HSV PCR were pending at the time of admission.\nThe patient was worked up for the differential of choreiform movements. High on the list of our suspicion was sydenham's chorea secondary to rheumatic fever. ASO titre was elevated at 215 IU/ML (<150), ESR was elevated at 55 mm/hr (0\u201310), and urine analysis was positive for proteins at 25 mg/dL (neg), ketones at 50 mg/dL, and small blood. The patient was initially started on penicillin.\nAn echocardiogram of the heart was done () which showed 9 mm \u00d7 8 mm echogenic, nonmobile area on the posterior mitral valve leaflet suspicious for thrombus versus vegetation with normal function, and anatomy of the valves.\nMRI of the brain was done which was normal except for nonspecific small white matter hyperintensities in the left frontal lobe.\nWith the patient's history of fever, and possible thrombus versus vegetation on echocardiogram, thought of infective endocarditis was entertained. Blood cultures were sent, and the patient started on Lovenox and ceftriaxone pending culture results. For the possible thrombus, coagulation workups were done including a prothrombin time which was normal. Test for Cardiolipin IgG was negative at 8.3 GPL (Neg < 10.0 GPL) and Borderline positive for Cardiolipin IgM at 14.5 GPL (Borderline 10.0\u201314.9 GPL).\nNext on the list of our differential was systemic lupus erythematosus. With Biologic mom's possible workup for autoimmune disease and the fact that chorea even though is a rare complication for SLE can be a presenting feature especially in pediatric SLE, a blood analysis for ANA was sent. Other labs that were done to rule out other causes of chorea including urine and serum toxicology screen, thyroid panel, and lyme titres which came back negative.\nOn day 2 of the hospital course ANA titres came back positive at 1 : 1280 with a homogenous pattern. Further testing for SLE revealed positive results for anti-DS DNA at 473 IU/ML (Neg < 100), anti-Smith antibodies at 177AU/mL (Neg < 100), Sjogren's anti-SS-A at 937 AU/mL (Neg < 100), Sjogren's anti-SS-B at 118 (Neg < 100), and antihistone abs at 330 AU/mL (Neg < 100), and complement levels for C3 was low at 55 mg/dL (86\u2013184). CPK levels were also abnormally elevated.\nBlood cultures and HSV PCR from the outlying hospital came back negative. Ceftriaxone and acyclovir were stopped and patient was started on IV steroids for SLE.\nThe patient's chorea dramatically improved after starting steroids. She received Solu-Medrol at 500 mg daily for 3 days and slowly tapered over to oral steroids over a course of 2 weeks. The patient was discharged home on oral steroids and Lovenox with follow-up appointments scheduled with rheumatology and cardiology.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n84.333", "task": "calc"}

Five days prior to her visit, she had upper respiratory symptoms and a low grade fever (). Oral administration of 400 mg acetaminophen relieved those symptoms. Then, however, she developed a butterfly-shaped erythema on her face and swelling of her fingers. Three days later, although the facial erythema had improved, she developed joint pain in her fingers, wrists, shoulders, and knees, for which acetaminophen did not work. On physical examination, the patient looked tired. Her body temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, blood pressure was 94/50 mmHg, and pulse rate was 61 beats/min. She weighed 48 kg and was 153 cm tall. She had no rash except for a malar erythema that was faint at that time. All her fingers were swollen, but her wrist, shoulder, and knee joints were not. Both her legs had pretibial pitting edema. Laboratory data showed mild hypoproteinemia (serum protein 6.4 g/dL) and slightly decreased peripheral white blood cell count (4,100/\u03bcL). However, other hematologic parameters were relatively normal (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 35.2%, reticulocyte 1.4%, and platelet count 230,000/\u03bcL). Liver enzymes and C-reactive protein levels were not elevated. Regardless of hypocomplementemia (C3 72 mg/dL, C4 9 mg/dL, and CH50 18.6 U/mL), the tests for serum antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Althoughthe IgG antibody was not examined, a positive result for HPV-B19 IgM antibody (index 7.97) indicated a recent infection of the virus []. Since microbiological tests for other viruses, such as measles and rubella, were negative, a diagnosis of HPV-B19 infection was finally made. Because her symptoms deteriorated despite the use of acetaminophen, oral administration of loxoprofen (180 mg/day) was alternatively started immediately after the diagnosis (). The symptoms, including facial erythema, polyarthralgia, and the swelling of her fingers, rapidly disappeared within 12 hours after the initiation of the drug.

The patient suffered from unstable insulin-dependent type I diabetes and sciatica. Considering 4 days of immobilization in bed, low molecular weight heparin (Dalteparin\u00a9 2500 UI one per day) was administered []. The patient underwent a planned caesarean section under double-space CSE anaesthesia, using a 25-gauge atraumatic spinal needle at level L3-L4 and an 18-gauge Thuoy needle at T12-L1 (B. Braun Perifix\u00ae epidural set), placed during a single attempt. Preoperative coagulation parameters were within normal range (Platelet count 120.000 per microliter of blood; Prothrombin time 12 s, Partial thromboplastin time 30 s, fibrinogen 540 mg/dL, INR 0.90). Renal function was normal. The operation was carried out routinely and multimodal pain therapy was started (Patient Controlled Epidural Anaesthesia - PCEA - with chirocaine 0,15% plus sufentanil 0,5 mcg/ml, 4 ml/h; i.v. ketorolac 30 mg/day and oral tramadol 30 mg plus acetaminophen 1000 mg/3 times/day). Four hours after the operation, the urinary catheter was removed, the patient began to stand up and to take care of the newborns. Dalteparin 2500 U/die was continued. PCEA was discontinued 2 days after the operation and the epidural catheter was removed on the 3rd day, 12 h after the last Dalteparin administration. Pain control was optimal. The following day, the patient remained hospitalized without any complications and the two babies were admitted in neonatology.\nAt 06.00 a.m. of the 6th post-operative day, more than 70 h after the removal of the epidural catheter, the patient complained of acute and severe low-back pain, radiating to the right inferior limb, and paresthesia; there was no motor impairment and she was treated with analgesic drugs without any improvement. After an abdominal ultrasound, urinary retention was observed and a bladder catheter was inserted (residual volume: 1100 ml). A right lower limb motor deficit was observed at 11:50 a.m. and methylprednisolone was administered. Since no improvement in the patient\u2019s clinical picture was seen, urgent neurological consultation was requested 8 h after the onset of symptoms (02.00 p.m.). A dorsal MRI scan showed the presence of a T12-L1 posterior SEH, predominantly on the right side, with significant mass-effect and spinal cord signal alteration in the conus medullaris region (Figs. and ). The patient was transferred to the Neurosurgical Department for decompression laminectomy and removal of the hematoma and the operation began at 07.00 p.m.. Immediately after surgery, the patient partially recovered her sensory disorder and motor functions. Five days after surgery she began intensive rehabilitation.\nIn the last follow-up examination (36 months later), while mostly improved, motor, sensory and sphincter deficits persisted in varying degrees.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nGK is a 43-year-old right-hand dominant nonsmoking female who presented to our office with right shoulder pain. The patient had symptoms for nine months following a motor-vehicle accident where she was a restrained passenger. The patient stated she had severe pain at the anterolateral aspect of her right shoulder, difficulty lifting greater than five pounds, limited overhead motion, and subjective catching. Physical examination showed her height, weight, and body mass index were 61 inches, 135 pounds, and 25.51, respectively. After history, physical, and radiographic examination, the patient was diagnosed with a rotator cuff strain, long head biceps tenosynovitis, and acromioclavicular joint osteolysis. Over the course of one year, the patient attended 36 sessions of physical therapy, participated in a home exercise program and underwent a subacromial cortisone injection with only temporary relief. Due to her lack of progress with conservative measures, an MRI arthrogram was obtained which showed a moderate bursal-sided tear of the supraspinatus, moderate acromioclavicular joint osteolysis, and a type II superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion. A discussion of nonoperative versus operative treatment options, outcomes, and complications occurred and the patient elected to go forward with surgery.\nAfter being brought into the operating room, the patient underwent an interscalene nerve block for intraoperative and postoperative pain control using a nerve stimulator. Bilateral lower extremity sequential compression devices were applied for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. General endotracheal tube anesthesia (GETA) was administered. The patient was then positioned into the modified lateral decubitus position (patient rolled back 30 degrees) using a foam wedge with all bony prominences well padded. An axillary roll was placed one hand breadth distal to the axilla, and the patient was secured with Velcro straps. After sterile draping and time-out, the patient's operative extremity was placed in ten pounds of balanced suspension in the scapular plane.\nUpon shoulder arthroscopy, the patient was found to have a type II SLAP lesion with a long head biceps that had inflammation and fraying. The articular side of the rotator cuff had mild fraying. When viewing the subacromial space, the patient's rotator cuff was found to have significant fraying, fragmentation, and thinning of the bursal side (type A1, B3). When probed, the supraspinatus was found to be of inadequate quality due to intrasubstance tearing. In addition, the acromioclavicular joint was arthritic. As a result, the patient underwent an arthroscopic take-down and repair of the rotator cuff, a distal clavicle excision, and a miniopen subpectoralis long head biceps tenodesis. The duration of the surgery was one hour and 45 minutes with the duration of balanced suspension one hour and 20 minutes. There were no complications intraoperatively. The patient was placed into a sling with an abduction pillow and awoken from the anesthesia with no incident. She was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.\nAt her initial postoperative visit six days after surgery, the patient presented with occasional pain in her shoulder with moderate swelling. She denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and sweats and had no calf tenderness. She was not menopausal. She was taking Percocet as needed as with appropriate relief but otherwise denied any additional medication history. Her incisions were clean and dry, and the stitches were removed and steri-strips applied. The patient was instructed to continue wearing her sling and abduction pillow except when performing twice daily Codman's exercises. Exercises for elbow, wrist, and finger range of motion were demonstrated, and the patient was advised to perform these twice per day.\nAt four weeks postoperatively, the patient's pain was well-controlled with no requirement for pain medication, and her wounds were well-healed. She denied fevers, chills, and calf pain. Her sling was discontinued and formal physical therapy was initiated as per our standard rotator cuff repair and biceps tenodesis protocol.\n41 days postoperatively, the patient called our office with new-onset right-hand swelling and trouble breathing. She also reported that she had been feeling \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d and stomach pains. She had no calf pain or lower extremity swelling. The patient was able to send our office a picture of her swollen hand over a secure email service with patient identification removed (). After seeing the photograph, she was advised to immediately follow up with us where upper extremity swelling and slightly labored breathing were confirmed.\nVital signs were stable and we ordered a stat computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram, which revealed that the patient had an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the subsegmental posterior basal segment artery of the right lower lobe (). A stat hematology consult was arranged, and the patient was admitted through the emergency room to the hematology service for further evaluation and management. The patient was started on a therapeutic dose of Lovenox and subsequently transitioned to per-oral Xarelto. Three days after admission, she underwent a bilateral upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound that was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An immediate ultrasound upon admission was not performed due to the hematologist service's need to stabilize the patient prior to additional testing. She had no pain, swelling, or tenderness in the left upper extremity or bilateral lower extremities. A full hematology analysis was performed and was negative for any predisposing genetic factors for VTE. In assessing the patient's objective risk factors for VTE, a Revised Geneva Score was calculated and resulted in a score of two, corresponding to low risk for DVT [].\nThree days after initiation of anticoagulation therapy, the patient's constitutional symptoms and discomfort with breathing resolved. Two weeks later, her upper extremity swelling resolved. Although her preoperative pain was completely resolved, the patient developed postoperative stiffness, and at six months postoperatively she had a protracted humeral head with active forward elevation 130 degrees, external rotation 45 degrees, and internal rotation to L5. Her strength with regard to her supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps was 5/5 with no pain, and a postoperative MRI at 6 months postoperatively showed complete healing of the supraspinatus repair and long head biceps tenodesis.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

His medications were calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers for hypertension\nOn preoperative examination, there were no abnormalities in blood tests including cardiac markers performed before surgery, and ECG (Fig. ) and chest imaging were normal. On echocardiography, the ejection fraction was 59%, and other findings were normal except for diastolic dysfunction grade 2.\nGlycopylorate (0.2 mg) was administered intravenously for premedication before surgery. The patient's vital signs were monitored through invasive arterial blood pressure (BP) monitoring using radial artery, ECG, capnometry, and pulse oximetry equipment. In the operating room, his initial BP, heart rate (HR), Sp02 were 164/91 mmHg, 78 beats/min and 98%, respectively. ECG was NSR. Oxygen (100%) was delivered for preoxygenation prior to anesthetic induction. General anesthesia was induced with 150 mg of propofol and isoflurane (INH) in oxygen. Five minute after the administration of 70 mg of rocuromium, tracheal intubation was performed. General anesthesia was maintained with INH (1 MAC), O2 at 2 L/min, nitrous oxide at 2 L/min. The right radial artery was cannulated for invasive arterial BP monitoring and frequent sampling.\nThe patient's vital signs before posture change for surgery were BP 110/70 mmHg and HR 75 beats/min. Five minutes after changing position from supine to prone, his vital signs were BP 95/62 mmHg, HR 80 beats/min, and QRS widening appeared in lead II.\nTo prepare for emergencies such as acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, the patient was placed in the supine position, and a 12 lead ECG was taken immediately (Fig. ). QRS widening (0.174 ms), absence of Q wave in lead I and V6, and monomorphic R wave V1-4 appeared in 12 lead ECG. Five minutes after changing the position to supine, his vital signs were BP 118/73 mmHg, HR 73 beats/min, and ECG changed to NSR.\nNSR and stable vital signs were observed for 20 minutes, and continuous 1.0 \u03bcg/kg/min nitroglycerin (NTG) was injected intravenously under the advice of a cardiologist. After the posture changed to the prone position, LBBB appeared again in lead II, the operation was performed with the LBBB maintained and vital signs were stable. The operation was completed without complications. After the operation, the ECG was normal in the post-anesthesia care unit. The patient complained of back pain only, and there was no chest pain or dyspnea.\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and a cardiac marker test was performed 3 times every 8 hours, and Holter tests were also performed for 24 hours. Cardiac markers were normal, and 24-hour Holter test results were transient right bundle branch block, LBBB, second degree atrioventricular (AV) block Mobitz type II. After two weeks of treatment, the patient was discharged and visited a tertiary hospital for a detailed cardiac examination. His coronary angio-computed tomography results showed right coronary artery with 30%-40% stenosis and left circumflex artery with 40%\u201350% stenosis.

Serum creatinine level was within the normal range, and proteinuria was not recognized. The serum protein electrophoresis showed an M-peak in the gamma fraction, although serum immunofixation test was not performed. The BM aspirate showed myeloma at that time; hence, he was initially diagnosed with symptomatic IgG myeloma. He was treated with two cycles of VAD therapy [28 days cycles of vincristine (0.4 mg/kg) with doxorubisin (9 mg/m2) by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days, and dexamethasone (40 mg/kg) by intravenous infusion for 4 days] as an induction treatment, by which he achieved partial response. The patient had his first recurrence in 2009 and received BD therapy consisting of Bor and Dex [] and achieved a very good partial response. In 2014, enlargement of the mediasinum without any symptoms was noted on a chest X-ray. The CT showed a mediastinal mass (), slight enlargement of the post-peritoneal lymph nodes, and moderate splenomegaly. The biopsied specimen obtained from the mediastinal mass exhibited diffused infiltration of small- to medium-sized atypical lymphocytes with plasma cell differentiation (). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD20 (), whereas atypical lymphoplasmacytes and plasmacytes were positive for CD138 (). The serum immunofixation test demonstrated dual monoclonal bands of IgG-kappa and IgG-lambda. BM aspirate revealed diffuse infiltration of small lymphocytes, lymphoplasmacytes, and plasmacytes. G-banding of the BM aspirate resulted in 46 and XY. FISH analyses for IgH-BCL1, chr 13q del, and chr 6q del were negative. MYD88 L265P mutation was also negative. Furthermore, reconfirmation of BM aspirate obtained in 2006 revealed that the neoplastic cells were composed of atypical small lymphocytes, lymphoplasmacytes, and plasmacytes. Therefore, the precise diagnosis was revised from IgG myeloma to IgG LPL after re-evaluation. After local radiation therapy (36 Gy/17 Fr), the mediastinal tumor disappeared, and the patient had no symptoms at that time.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 81-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital with recurrent falls associated with brief loss of consciousness. She denied any other cardiac symptoms. Her past medical history included an embolic cerebrovascular event a year earlier with no residual focal neurology, hypertension, treated hypothyroidism, diverticulosis, anaemia of chronic disease, and chronic noninfective diarrhoea of 3 years' duration. This had been extensively investigated by several gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons.\nOn admission she was passing 8\u201310 loose motions a day. She was on treatment with levothyroxine 125 micrograms OD, clopidogrel 75 mg OD, aspirin 75 mg OD, atorvastatin 40 mg OD, ranitidine 150 mg BD, zopiclone 7.5 mg OD, citalopram 10 mg OD, folic acid 5 mg OD, loperamide 2 mg TDS, co-codamol 8/500 2 tablets QDS, and desloratadine 5 mg OD.\nOn examination she was apyrexial, the pulse was 60 beats per minute and regular, and the supine blood pressure was 157/55 mmHg. Saturation on air was 95%. The rest of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination was within normal limits. There were no history of liquorice use, no clinical evidence of somatic neuropathy, and no evidence of adrenal adenomas on abdominal CT examination done prior to admission.\nThe investigations were as follows: haemoglobin 12.7 g/L, sodium 143 mmol/L, potassium 3.0 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate 27.6 mmol/L, pH 7.46, magnesium 0.72 mmol/L, adjusted calcium 2.21 mmol/L, phosphate 1.08 mmol/L, TSH 0.22 \u03bc/mL, free T4 25 pmol/L, and C Reactive Protein (CRP) 89 mg/L. The admission resting ECG revealed ventricular bigeminy and prolongation of the QTc at 519 msec (normal for females < 470 msec), measured using Bazett's formula as heart rate was less than 65 bpm. Telemetry and Holter analysis confirmed the presence of multiple episodes of polymorphic VT (Torsades de Pointes) (). An echocardiogram confirmed a structurally normal heart with a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%. Coronary angiography confirmed normal appearances with no evidence of overt coronary artery disease.\nThe patient's episodes of polymorphic VT stopped following administration of intravenous and oral potassium as well as magnesium supplementation () and the discontinuation of citalopram, which has been associated with development of long QT syndrome and Torsade de Pointes as an adverse drug reaction []. The QTc normalised within 48 hours following this. The patient was treated with loperamide 4 mg prn and amiloride 5 mg daily to correct the hypokalaemia. Following these interventions potassium levels remained above 4.0 mmol/L. Despite the administration of amiloride and normalisation of the potassium the patient was still experiencing ongoing diarrhoea. Additionally there were past blood tests (ordered by the patient's GP) documenting low potassium levels in the preceding 2 years. With that in mind the cardiology MDT felt that the precipitating cause of the Torsades de Pointes was not fully addressed and thus an ICD would offer the best change of preventing an arrhythmic death. An ICD (dual chamber, Medtronic Evera) was thus prophylactically implanted. Due to the patient's age and in the absence of any previous or family history of syncope and ventricular arrhythmias no genetic tests were performed.\nOn follow-up after six months, she remained asymptomatic with no further syncopal events or symptoms of light headedness, blurred vision, or feeling faint. Repeat blood tests by her GP at 3 and 6 months showed potassium of 4.1 and 4.2 mmol/L, respectively, and she was continuing to take amiloride. No arrhythmias were detected on interrogation of the ICD at the follow-up.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n2.4", "task": "calc"}

He was scheduled for external fixation. On examination, the patient was conscious and well oriented. There was no history of loss of consciousness, vomiting or bleeding from oral and nasal cavities. The patient was a smoker since last 25 years (10 cigarettes/day). He denied any other medical comorbidity or surgical treatment in the past. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of head was normal, blunt trauma chest and abdomen was ruled out, no cervical spine injury was observed and hemodynamic parameters were also stable. Airway examination revealed mouth opening of 3 cm, thyromental distance of 8 cm, and full range of neck movements. Airway was classified as Mallampatti class II. Preoperative chest radiograph was normal and electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm. Hemogram, coagulogram and renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. Functional capacity was more than 4 metabolic equivalents (METS).\nAfter explaining the procedure and risk involved to the patient, written informed consent was taken. In the operating room, ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry were attached and baseline parameters noted. An 18-G intravenous cannula was secured. Preoperative heart rate (HR) was 90/min, blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate 16/min, and SpO2 (on room air) was 97%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) showed pH 7.35, pO2 98, pCO2 26, HCO3 15, BE \u20135, and SaO2 97%.\nAn 18-G epidural catheter was inserted via the L3-L4 space with the patient in a sitting position, using midline approach, and fixed at 11 cm. At the same level, 15 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy was administered in the subarachnoid with a 25-G Quincke's spinal needle. Supplemented oxygen was administered by a venturi facemask (FiO2 0.5). A sensory loss up to T10 level was achieved with adequate motor paralysis after 9 min and surgery was then started. ECG, NIBP, and SpO2 were monitored. About 35 minutes after the administration of the subarachnoid block, the patient complained of dyspnea and chest pain. There was a sudden fall in SpO2 to 82% from 100%. The patient became tachypneic, started coughing and his HR rose to 126/ min. However, BP was within normal limits and ECG showed no marked changes. ABG showed pH 7.36, pO2 65.6, pCO2 45, HCO3 17.2, BE \u20136.1, and SaO2 82%. The patient was given continuous positive airway pressure of 100% oxygen with a facemask. SpO2 increased from 82% to 96%. A sample for D-dimer test was sent with the suspicion of pulmonary embolism. The patient had another bout of cough and SpO2 fell to 79-80%, BP to 81/54 mm Hg, and HR was 125/min. Dopamine infusion was started. On chest auscultation, there was reduced breath sounds on the right side. ABG values were pH 7.32, pO2 55.5, pCO2 54.2, HCO3 17, BE \u20136.9, and SaO2 80%. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl 70 \u03bcg and thiopental 300 mg. Intravenous vecuronium 7 mg was administered and trachea secured with 8.5 mm endotracheal tube. The position of the tracheal tube was confirmed by capnography. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. A chest radiograph was taken immediately, which showed a right-sided pneumothorax. Cardiothoracic consultation was taken and an underwater seal intercostal drain placed. After 5 minutes, HR improved to 80/min, BP 110/69 mm Hg, and SpO2 97%. The surgery lasted for 130 minutes and was completed without any further complication. Postoperatively, SpO2 was 97%, BP 105/62 mm Hg, and HR 113/min. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated on Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) mode with pressure support.\nIn ICU, the patient was monitored closely with invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation, airway pressure, and serial ABG. The D-dimer test report showed elevated values and color Doppler of lower limbs showed deep vein thrombosis of the right lower limb. Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously 12 hourly) was started. Bed-side two-dimensional echocardiography in the ICU showed mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension [RV systolic pressure (RVSP) = right atrial pressure (RAP) + 31 mm Hg], and hypokinesia of the right ventricular wall.\nPostoperative analgesia was achieved with epidural injection of 8 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine 6 hourly, and epidural catheter was removed after 48 hours. The patient was weaned off ventilator support after three days and the trachea was extubated. Oxygen supplementation with venturi facemask (FiO2 0.5) was given for another two days.

He had no recent travel history. His family history included immunoglobulin (Ig) A deficiency in his 18-month-old son and a several-year history of nonspecific colitis in his father. Regular medications were nifedipine CR (30 mg/day) and rosuvastatin (5 mg/day).\nThe patient initially presented to his family physician with a symmetrical polyarthralgia involving his knees and hands, odynophagia, temporal headache, retro-ocular pain, and an intermittent fever (maximum of 38\u00b0C). He was initially managed with an antibiotic (azithromycin) and anti-inflammatory agents without resolution of symptoms. One week later, he developed oral mucosal lesions and a vesicular rash on his palms and soles (Figures and ). In April 2011, 3 weeks after the initial presentation, he was admitted to the emergency room at the Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon) with compressive retrosternal pain, without dyspnea or a productive cough. The odynophagia was persistent, with worsening of the headache and arthralgia.\nThe emergency staff noted nonexudative oropharyngitis and tender cervical lymphadenopathy with normal cardiorespiratory examination findings and absence of a pericardial friction rub. He had abdominal tenderness in the right lower quadrant without guarding. There were no vesicles on the palms of his hands or soles of his feet, but the skin had a scalded appearance. There was slight ST-segment depression on the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and mildly increased levels of troponin I and creatine kinase-MB fraction. The diagnosis of myopericarditis was considered. He started ibuprofen at 400 mg three times a day and was admitted for further workup.\nAs an inpatient, his condition slowly improved. His fever resolved and he was discharged with only slight fatigue during strenuous exercise. The skin vesicles disappeared and progressed to scaliness (Figure ).\nLaboratory examination showed positive serology for coxsackie A9 (IgM with a titer of 1:160) 1 week after the disappearance of the vesicular rash. It is assumed that a titer of >1:80 is predictive of a diagnosis of the infection in question. In addition, he was positive for IgA anti-transglutaminase 25 (<20 U/mL) and IgA anti-gliadin 77 (<25 U/mL) antibodies, with higher titers during follow-up after discharge (59 and 60 U/mL, respectively). He had normal immunoglobulin levels and was negative for antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-DNA antibody (dsDNA), and p- and c-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Serology for viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Endoscopy revealed a normal appearance of the gastric and duodenal mucosae, and biopsy showed slight mucosal architecture disruption.\nAn echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricle, slightly hypertrophic interventricular septum, normal systolic function (ejection fraction of 60%), and left atrium in the upper limit of the normal range. The ECG findings and cardiac biomarker levels returned to normal after 5 days.\nTo ameliorate the abdominal pain and bloating, a gluten-free diet was introduced, and this proved to be helpful with normalization of the anti-transglutaminase and anti-gliadin antibodies 6 months later.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "output": "### Response:\n1", "task": "calc"}

She subsequently demonstrated evidence of severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI), of which the latter resolved.\nThe main reason for her subsequent PICU stay was for neurological rehabilitation and transition to home ventilation. She was receiving treatment for dystonia, heart failure, endocarditis, and pulmonary embolism. At the request of the parents, stem cell therapy for neurological dysfunction was investigated. As metformin has shown properties to recruit existing neural stem cells and enhance neural functions, a trial of therapy was initiated. The patient was placed on metformin (20 mg/kg) 17 days before the event, which was increased to 40 mg/kg (250 mg twice-daily) six days prior to the event.\nOn the day of the event, the patient acutely presented with a new wide complex bradycardia 70\u201380 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 110\u2013120 bpm and peaked T waves. The other vital signs were blood pressure = 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate = 26 breaths per minute, temperature = 37.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation = 87% on her baseline ventilation settings. She was poorly perfused with prolonged capillary refill time and lethargic.

Three years ago, the patient was diagnosed with \u201costeoporosis and thoracic compression fracture\u201d at a local hospital. After surgical treatment, the patient did not use regular medication. Last year, the patient experienced fatigue and severe back pain with lower extremity pain after lifting heavy objects, which was not relieved by rest but gradually increased. Upon examination in our clinic, moon face, central obesity, and purple stripes on the lower limbs were noted. The patient was 162 cm in height and weighed 70 kg, with a body mass index of 26.6. The resting blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg. The patient also had type II diabetes. Laboratory tests showed that lutenizing hormone dramatically decreased to 0.17 mIU/mL; follicle-stimulating hormone level was 2.25 mIU/mL which was within the normal range; aldosterone level was 0.2 ng/mL, plasma renin activity was 4.4 ng/mL, and angiotensin II level was 42.55 pg/mL. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone level was within normal range, and plasma cortisol level was 1122 nmol/L (normal <327 nmol/L in the morning). Only slight suppression of plasma cortisol was found during an overnight 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test, from 1291 to 1150 nmol/L. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test failed to suppress plasma cortisol. This test provided evidence of nonpituitary-dependent CD. However, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a sellar mass measuring approximately 7.6 \u00d7 5.7 mm (Fig. ). The lesion was slightly hypointense on T2-weighted images. The patient was diagnosed with pituitary microadenoma. Thus, the diagnosis of pituitary-dependent CD could not be fully ruled out. The controversial test results led to a dilemma in the preoperative diagnosis. Surgeons preferred a diagnosis of pituitary-dependent CD than nonpituitary-dependent CD for this case. After being provided with detailed information, the patient requested to undergo transsphenoidal surgery to remove the pituitary mass. During the surgery, a small tumor was identified and removed. An intraoperative frozen section was examined and diagnosed as pituitary adenoma.\nHowever, after 2 postoperative weeks, plasma cortisol levels and blood pressure did not decrease. Resting blood pressure was 155/98 mm Hg, and plasma cortisol level was 1066 nmol/L. Meanwhile, histopathological of the remaining tissue sections confirmed pituicytoma.

The patient was positioned right lateral and all the pressure points were well padded. After painting and draping, one-lung ventilation was initiated. Two 10 mm ports and one 5 mm port were put and surgery started. However, due to suspected iatrogenic injury to the left lower lobe, the surgery was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy. Further, intraoperative analgesia was maintained with intermittent fentanyl boluses. Thorough adhesiolysis, repair of lacerated lung and pleural toileting were done. Two chest drains were put and chest wall was closed. In view of open thoracotomy, we planned for continuous ESP block for postoperative analgesia.

The pain worsened after long time standing, walking and working and relieved when bending and crouching. Numerical rating scale (NRS, an 11-point scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain) scored 4. The patient tried some unknown painkillers but they did not work. The intermittent pain lasted for years until 2 years ago when he started to have numbness of both lower limps, ranging from both sides of calfs to the dorsum of feet. Intermittent claudication occurs within 500 m\u2019 walking. No cauda equina syndrome (CES) appeared. It should be noticed that this man gained 55 kg in weight during the past 20 years. Relevant history included hypertension for 10 years, smoking for 30 years and drinking for 30 years. In recent two weeks there was a fluctuation of blood sugar but no formal monitoring record was available. This patient had never received steroids medications.\nA full endocrinologic workup was conducted in patient to rule out underlying endocrine abnormalities and type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. On physical exam, the patient showed 5/5 strength, normal muscle tone and intact superficial sensation in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Tendon reflexes of the right knee was absent and several myelopathic signs were recorded as follows: Chaddock sign ( +) on the left, Oppenheim sign ( +) on the left and Babinski sign suspected ( +) on both sides. CT scan indicated typical signs of LSS: intervertebral foraminal stenosis, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, disc paracentral herniation and spinal stenosis from L2 to L5 (Fig. ), and MRI showed epidural abnormal fat deposition in the spinal canal from L2\u2013L5 (Fig. ). According to a previous study of Borre et al., SEL could be graded on basis of the degree of epidural adipose tissue occupying the spinal canal (extradural fat [EF]-to spinal canal [SC] ratio); grade I, 41\u201350% of the canal; grade II, 51\u201374% of the canal; and grade III, > 75% of the canal []. This patient\u2019s imaging revealed grade II (60% EF/SC ratio) lumbar epidural lipomatosis (Fig. d).\nBased on the patient\u2019s symptoms, history, physical examination and radiological imaging, a primary diagnosis of LSS and obesity-induced idiopathic SEL from L2\u2013L5 was proposed. The compression of the cauda equina came from anterior protruding lumbar disc and posterior adipose tissue and ligamentum flavum, and pressure on nerve root is caused by intervertebral foraminal bony stenosis. Since refractory radiculopathic symptoms had appeared, indication of surgery was clear. Mimimally invasive surgery like endoscopic technique was insufficient to relieve bony stenosis, so extensive decompression was necessary. Internal fixation and bone graft fusion were adopted to maintain the stability of responsible vertebrae. Although the modified articular fusion had never been reported in such a rare disease, it was performed successfully in a large amount of obese patients with lumbar degenerative disease only. This was our first application of this modified surgical style on obesity SEL.\nAfter a preoperative use of prophylactic antibiotics (cefuroxime 1.5 g, intravenous), the operation was performed under general anesthesia and in a prone position. Following careful stripping of the paraspinal muscles, spinous process, bilateral articular processes and roots of transverse processes were exposed. Afterwards, titanium polyaxial pedicle screws (6.5 mm in diameter, 50 mm long, Legacy, Medtronic, USA) were inserted bipedicularly from the L2 to L5 vertebrae. We chose used F4 reverse thread screws providing a tightening power in horizontal direction and minimizes the possibility of pulling out. This is quite important for such a patient with hight body weight. Then, pre-bended titanium rods were implanted and intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory position and length of screws. The resection range included spinous processes (L3, L4 and small portion of L2 and L5), 2/3 of the inferior L2 lamina, L3 and L4 lamina and 1/5 of upper L5 lamina, as well as the corresponding supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum and joint capsule. Then hyperplastic medial portion of facet joints, atrophic ligamentum flavum, stenosis of lumbar lateral recess and accumulation of epidural adipose tissue contributing to dural sac compression was visible (Fig. a). Decompression range of L2\u2013L3 included medial 2/3 of the L2 bilateral inferior articular process, 1/3 of the medial side of bilateral superior articular processes of L5 and hyperplastic medial portion of L3 superior articular processes. Medial 2/3 of the bilateral L2 inferior articular process and 1/3 of the medial side of bilateral superior articular processes of L3 was carried out with a chisel and the lateral 2/3 portion was preserved for bone grafting. Management of L3\u2013L4 and L4\u2013L5 was the same as the above description. Following the decompression was resection of epidural adipose tissue with bipolar cautery (Fig. b).\nSubsequently, inspection verified an adequate relaxation of nerve root and full decompression of dural sac. Removed tissue (Fig. c) had the appearance of normal adipose tissue. A round head grinding drill was then used to prepare the inter-articular space as grafting bed for autograft and allograft cancellous bone. After that, the surgery field was rinsed with saline before bone graft was pressed into the inter-articular space. Finally, a drainage tube was put in place and the wound was closed up. Intraoperative hemorrhage was 586 mL.\nThe patient showed full muscle strength and sensation once regained consciousness. Preoperative symptoms relieved obviously during the following days, and NRS scored 1. We removed the drainage tube and encouraged the patient to stand and walk on the third day after operation. Radiographs of lumbar spine were taken to verify the good location of screws and rods (Fig. ), and MRI confirmed complete decompression and elimination of excessive fat tissue (Fig. ). The patient was permitted to discharge with referral for outpatient rehabilitation. We also mobilized this patient to lose weight.\nBy now the man has come back for follow-up regularly and his low back and radiating leg pain has completely resolved, and NRS scored 0. X-Ray, CT and MRI at different follow-up time points showed persistent stability and graft and satisfactory fusion rate, and no evidence of reoccurred SEL was detected (Figs. and ).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n70.465", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 71-year-old Moslem Arab man with a 29-year duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy, presented to our outpatient clinic, after a three-month period of severe neuropathic paresthetic pain in four extremities and his buttocks (saddle paresthesia). The pain estimate was 10/10 visual analog scale (VAS). Concomitantly, he had lost 20kg of weight, felt anorectic, nervous and sad, had insomnia, tremors, a feeling of general coldness, and was suffering from new constipation and orthostatic complaints. Consequent to orthostatism, his antihypertensive medications were reduced to minimum; ramipril was stopped and atenolol was decreased.\nAt admission, he complained of dry mouth, fatigue, lethargy and a feeling of suffocation. Recent hemoglobin A1c (9.1%) was achieved on 30 unit/day premixed insulin and metformin 850mg trice daily. Other laboratory findings revealed moderate anemia and chronic mild/moderate renal failure (Table ).\nA few weeks prior to his visit, he completed negative thorough endoscopic gastrointestinal testing, as well as whole-body computed tomography (CT) scans searching for neoplastic findings. Except for incidental sporadic lymphangiectasis and an arteriovenous (AV) malformation found in the small bowel and a thyroidal nodule, all test results were within normal limits.\nHe could not recall any changes in facial features, neither had he noticed an increase in shoe size; he attributed his rounded thick fingers to years of manual carpentry.\nOn physical examination he was pale and distressed. His blood pressure was 124/63mmHg; pulse, 107 beats per minute; body weight, 86.9kg; height, 171cm; and body mass index (BMI), 29.7kg/m2. His facial features were coarse with thickened lips and wide nostrils; he had a palmar fine tremor and a systolic murmur of 2/6. Diminished tendon reflexes were observed in four extremities. There was glove and sock hypoesthesia, and distal weakness of the hands with normal strength of the lower extremities. His current illnesses were arterial hypertension; hearing loss; right carpal tunnel syndrome; obstructive sleep apnea; hyperlipidemia; hiatus hernia with reflux; and benign prostatic hypertrophy.\nWith negative thorough weight loss investigation, major neoplastic disease and inflammatory bowel disease were ruled out. Absent relevant complaints of malabsorption rendered these diagnoses unlikely.\nA thyroid nodule was confirmed by sonography, which was 3.3cm in diameter. His thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.19 was reported one month prior to the repetitive CTs (with iodinated contrast media). It became suppressed thereafter, with elevated thyroid hormone levels (Table ). The thyroid technetium scan showed asymmetrical goiter and low isotope uptake. Thyroid radioiodine uptake (RAIU) was 1% and 10% after 2 and 24 hours, respectively. Thyroidal fine needle aspirate (FNA) was consistent with normal thyroid follicular findings.\nNormal findings were detected in his complete blood count, liver and kidney functions tests, B12, rheumatic diseases profile, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, C-reactive protein and transferrin tests.\nWe hypothesized that this grave neuropathic suffering underpinned a catabolic and inflammatory mechanism to drive significant emaciation, and to finally result in weight loss, anemia and disrupted acute phase reactants (ferritin and iron). Ferritin was high in contrast to a low correspondent iron level. Ferritin levels observed over time showed a prominent decline before iron stores were replenished (Table ).\nNeurological consultation included physical examination, electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies to the lower extremities. Electrophysiological studies revealed a pattern that was consistent with sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Gastric solid emptying scintigraphy revealed minimal isotope passage to the small intestine 3.5 hours after ingestion of a labeled meal.\nBiochemical parameters, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, established acromegaly (Table ); a head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a small gadolinium-enhanced pituitary mass of 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3mm.\nThe patient\u2019s depressed mood appeared to be mainly attributable to his remarkable neuropathic pains. Hence, we attributed his weight loss to the rare diagnosis of DNC, which accounts for profound weight loss, anorexia, orthostatism, disordered mood and sleep disturbances.\nWe posted control of the neuropathic suffering as the first priority, and ameliorating hyperthyroxinemia as a secondary requirement; we decided that establishing the cause of acromegaly and its respective treatment to be the lowest of the three priorities.\nWeight loss investigation was concluded as negative, after the comprehensive work-up our patient underwent in his local community-based hospital, he denied alcohol intake or past porphyria attacks. Our patient reported a satisfying increase in appetite and gained weight parallel to the decrease in neuropathic suffering (Figure ). However, infrequently he experienced protracted post-meal vomiting, which did not hamper his weight regain. The gastric emptying test was found to be prominently prolonged as a result of gastroparesis; later on, he experienced an increase in protracted post-meal vomiting once he had been started on a somatostatin analog for acromegaly.\nNeuropathy was treated by maximal pregabaline (75mg daily adjusted to serum creatinine) and achieved a pronounced clinical response in respective neuropathic pains. Our patient\u2019s pain estimate dropped to 4 to 5/10 VAS, concomitantly.\nGlycemia treatment, including premix insulin doses, was increased up to 70 units in order to keep glycemia relatively under control. This control was achieved parallel to the clinical and laboratory improvement. A hemoglobin A1c of 7.5% three months after admission enabled reconstitution of oral antidiabetics, once glucotoxicity had abated. Metformin was reinstituted and vildagliptin added; both treatments were modified according to the patient\u2019s renal status. Hypoglycemic events prompted a decrease of insulin dosage, and a switch from premix to basal insulin (daily dosage 28 units). Subsequently, our patient experienced a gradual increase in glycemia, which was ascribed to active acromegaly, and the iatrogenic effect of somatostatin analogs on glucose homeostasis (suppressed endogenous insulin).\nHyperthyroxinemia was ascribed to contrast media iodide load, on a preexisting autonomous nodule. His RAIU uptake was respectively low. His thyroid FNA and follow-up function test results were consistent with a benign thyroid nodule. Moderate renal failure was projected in long-term iodide load disposal. However, thyroid function indices dropped spontaneously back to the normal range after eight weeks. His TSH level reverted to pre-evaluation level 16 weeks later.\nAcromegaly was hormonally established (Table ) as a pituitary adenoma-related acromegaly (by MRI). Echocardiography demonstrated negligible mild intraventricular septal hypertrophy.\nOur patient preferred a somatostatin analog over transsphenoidal adenomectomy. He was started on lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 60mg/month several months after his first visit. Lanreotide failed to achieve good metabolic control: his IGF-1 remained elevated (437ng/ml). Our patient was asked to reconsider pituitary adenomectomy subsequent to the failure of lanreotide, as well as due to the untoward effects of lanreotide (aggravated glycemia deterioration and aggravated gastroparesis-related post-meal vomiting).\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n74.866", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe patient was a 23-year-old Italian male, professional cyclist, non-smoker, 190 cm tall and 82 kg, with a daily training load ranging from three to six hours, six days a week for an upcoming competition. The patient presented with no prior medical record but spontaneous and multidirectional multiple posterior dislocations of the right shoulder. In association with this complaint, the patient stated that he had widespread pain of the GHJ and paresthesias of the entire right hand, but predominantly on the palmar side of the fourth and fifth finger. Moreover, he complained about diffuse spasms (clonic manifestations) occurring around the shoulder, primarily of the pectoralis major and the biceps brachii muscles ().\nAfter a fall during a cycling race, the athlete went to a medical clinic in March 2017 and was diagnosed with subsequent dislocations of the right shoulder. The fall occurred following contact with a teammate during an international championship while riding on a paved road. The patient was not able to describe the exact traumatic mechanism but remembers his attempt to place his hands toward the ground to avoid the collision. The diagnostic investigation at the time, a magnetic resonance image (MRI), signaled the presence of \u201cintra-articular effusion with non-homogeneity of the antero-inferior portion of the glenoid rim, bone marrow edema on the anterior surface of the humeral head, and an extensive lesion of the subscapularis tendon\u201d (). The anamnestic examination was highlighted by a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) [] of 6/10 (while the patient was at rest), widespread tenderness on the entire joint complex, and positive clinical tests (posterior drawer test, sulcus sign, load and shift, and apprehension test). The patient did not report further trauma to the joint until May 2018, when, during normal work activities (while lifting a box onto a shelf that was above shoulder height), the patient experienced another posterior dislocation of his right shoulder. After this dislocation, the number of episodes of dislocation during limb movements in normal daily activities of living increased in frequency and intensity. Subsequently, spasms of the joint complex followed these episodes and became more frequent with multiple spontaneous and multidirectional dislocations of the shoulder ().\nIn June 2018, he returned to the clinic, complaining of a worsening of his clinical presentation and symptoms, characterized by an increase in spasmodic muscles surrounding his right shoulder, resulting in spontaneous multidirectional dislocations. The patient stated that these muscle spasms were associated with constant pain that worsened after the event and caused significant instability, weakness, and temporary tingling of the entire hand that was predominately located in the fourth and fifth finger. The spasms did not occur at night during sleep but appeared randomly and without warning throughout the day without apparent cause according to the patient. The patient also noted that the spasms were influenced by the patient\u2019s mental state (with a reported increase of episodes and worsening following family disputes).\nBy analyzing the patient\u2019s clinical history, family history, and the assessment scales, the PT identified various red and orange flags [] during the medical history and through analysis of the patient\u2019s disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) rating scale (depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders). At the initial evaluation, the PT observed that the right shoulder was in an anterior and internally rotated position. The patient\u2019s right scapula was also abducted and internally rotated. Muscular trophism was reduced in front of the contralateral side: Deltoid, biceps, and pectoral were hypotrophic. No differences in temperature, skin color, or swelling were appreciable and there were no scars present.\nThe PT had no opportunity to perform any clinical tests as the patient\u2019s passive and active movements immediately set off multidirectional joint dislocations and any type of stimulation increased the spontaneous muscle spasms. Three assessment scales were used by the PT to frame pain presentation (NPRS), disability/psychosocial factors (DASH) [], and instability patterns (Western Ontario shoulder instability index (WOSI)) [].\nThe patient\u2019s NPRS was 8/10. The DASH score was used to evaluate the disability/psychosocial factors: This scale evaluates the patient\u2019s ability to perform a range of daily, work-related, and sports/recreational activities. The DASH reported a 74.6% disability for daily life activities (ADL) and a 100% disability for work/recreational activities.\nThe WOSI was used to evaluate the pathology-specific life quality for the patient with shoulder instability and the patient performed at 5.43%.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n84.047", "task": "calc"}

Abdominal computed tomography with contrast showed only mild fatty changes of the liver.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was done; she was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily and discharged home on that dose awaiting the liver biopsy result. Later on this confirmed our diagnosis of AIH as it showed lobular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (fig. ), Councilman bodies and spotty necrosis. Bile duct damage and bridging periportal fibrosis were present (fig. ). In March 2013, the patient had improved clinically. Her liver enzymes were checked while she was still taking 60 mg prednisone daily with the following values: AST 360 IU/l, ALT 602 IU/l, ALP 92 IU/l, GGTP 398 IU/l and total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dl. After receiving the liver biopsy result, she was prescribed oral azathioprine 50 mg daily while tapering the prednisone dose. Her liver function was periodically checked with continuous improvement. In April 2013, she was taking both 20 mg prednisone and 50 mg azathioprine daily. In June 2013, the azathioprine was stopped and she was kept on oral prednisone 10 mg daily, which later on (in September 2013) was decreased to 5 mg daily. Her liver function has been always within the normal range since July 2013 with AST 40 IU/l, ALT 35 IU/l, ALP 37 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, GGTP 60 IU/l, total protein 6.8 g/dl and albumin 3.9 g/dl.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n-6.0", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 45-year-old woman, farmer by occupation, presented to our center with fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and painful rash in the lower extremities. She was apparently well until before 15 days when she developed a fever and sore throat followed by a painful rash on her legs three days later. She visited a primary care center where she was prescribed a seven-day course of intramuscular ceftriaxone with a provisional diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, which resolved the sore throat and fever but not the rash. When her fever relapsed several days later, this time accompanied by swelling of cervical nodes, the patient was referred to Nork Infectious Clinical Hospital in Yerevan for further evaluation and management. At presentation, her blood pressure was measured 115/70 mmHg, the temperature was 102\u02daF, pulse rate was 102 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 18 per minute. General examination revealed few enlarged tender cervical nodes on the left side of her neck and multiple red, firm, and tender lump-like rash (erythema nodosum) on both her legs (Figure ).\nSystemic examination was unremarkable. Blood workup revealed leukocytosis with relative lymphocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 55 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein of 35 mg/L. We admitted her for a thorough evaluation. Serology for Streptococcus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, Cytomegalovirus, Brucella, and leptospirosis were all negative. With unremarkable chest X ray and negative tuberculin test, we also eliminated sarcoidosis and tuberculosis as possible infectious causes of the erythema nodosum. She was diagnosed with tularemia based on latex agglutination testing, which came positive. A 14-day course of intramuscular streptomycin two grams daily divided into two doses was prescribed. Five days into treatment, the patient\u2019s fever subsided, the buboes shrank, and the erythema nodosum resolved. The patient was discharged on the eighth day of admission with subsequent follow-up. Potentially exposed persons, particularly the family members, were advised to be vigilant about the symptoms, especially the development of fever for two weeks. They were informed about the water and food hygiene, which might have been the possible source of infection.

The patient is the third child of the fourth pregnancy, one of which ended up with abortion. He was born at term, through Cesarean section, weighting 3400 g. Down syndrome was suspected clinically at birth and confirmed by karyotyping (47XX, t21).\nThe body weight on admission was 14.5 kg and the body height was 93 cm (20th and 5th percentile for sex and age in Down syndrome, respectively) ().\nTypical features of Down syndrome were present, including typical facies and generalized hypotonia. A 3/6 heart murmur was heard on auscultation, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a low grade aortic regurgitation. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory studies revealed red blood cell count 2.14 \u00d7 1012/l, Hb 6.1 gr/dL, Htc 17.5%, platelet count 272000/mm3, white blood cell count 7800/mm3, ESR 60 mm/h, CRP 26 mg/l, urea 12.7 mmol/1, creatinine 160 umol/1, Na 136 mEq/L, K 2.7 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L, Ca 9.8 mg/dL, ionised Ca 1.28 mmol/1, Mg 1.0 mmol/1, total serum proteins 59.6 g/l, albumins 32.3 g/l, fasting blood glucose 5.6 mmol/l, cholesterol 6,1 mmol/l, triglycerides 2.3 mmol/l and alkaline phosphatase 49 U/l. Results of the capillary blood gas analysis were as follows: pH 7.25, PCO2 26 mmHg, HCO3 14 mEq/L and serum anion gap 14 mEq/L.\nRoutine urine analysis showed mild proteinuria (+) and negative glucose. Urine microscopy showed 15 erythrocytes/hpf, 20 leucocytes/hpf and 20-30 bacteria/hpf; specific gravity was 1.005, and urinary pH was 7.0. Urine culture resulted positive for E.

The urine calcium to creatinine ratio was 1.2 mmol/mmol (normal value < 1.1 mmol/mmol). In the view of normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, alkaline urine and hypokalemia the diagnosis of dTRA was made.\nAdditional analysis searching for etiology of dTRA revealed serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 1.2 ng/ml (normal values 10.8-54 ng/ml), parathyroid hormone 27.2 pg/ml (normal values 6.5-36.8 pg/ml), free serum T4 2.20 pmol/l (normal values 10.3-25.8 pmol/l) and thyroid-stimulating hormone >1000.0 mU/l (normal values 0.54-4.21 mU/l). Prolactin was 163.9 ng/mL (normal values 3.2-20 ng/mL), while other hormonal profiles such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and growth hormone were normal. Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was >1000.0 IU/ml (normal value <50 IU/ml) and Thyroglobulin (hTg) was 3.41 ng/ml (normal values 0.2-70.0 ng/ml). Hence, Hashimoto thyroiditis as a possible cause was postulated. Moreover, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test resulted negative.\nThe renal ultrasound showed hyper-echoic regions in the renal medulla consistent with bilateral nephrocalcinosis grade I (), also confirmed by abdominal CT (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed pituitary enlargement ().\nTreatment and follow up\nIntravenous rehydration was started. The bicarbonate deficit was calculated, and KCl was added after the patient had his first urinary void. Blood gas analysis after 12 hours revealed increasing pH, HCO3 and K values. Packed red blood cells were then administered. The patient was put on potassium citrate and thyroid hormone substitution therapy. Also, intravenous antibiotherapy and oral ferrous supplements were started to treat urinary tract infection and anemia, respectively. On follow-up after six months, no evidence of metabolic acidosis and a nearly normal serum potassium level (3.4 mEq/L) were found. Urinary random analysis was normal. Patient\u2019s weight was 16 kg and his height 98 cm (25th and 10th percetile, respectively). His thyroid hormone profile was within normal range.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 58-year-old woman presented with lower abdominal pain from the deep pelvis and frequent failure of flatulence for 4 mo.\nShe was referred from a department of gynecology and diagnosed with a suspicious leiomyosarcoma of the rectum or a pedunculated myoma of the uterus after colonoscopy and abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) in a previous hospital. She visited the outpatient clinic after 10 d and was transferred to the emergency center because of severe lower left abdominal pain on 2 d before her scheduled admission. She had nausea, vomiting, and non-whirling dizziness. She was diagnosed with colonic cancer perforation with an abscess and was admitted for antibiotic treatment. We ensured that the acute septic condition was stabilized, and the patient underwent operation.\nShe had no co-morbid disease.\nOn digital rectal examination, a circumferential fungating mass with a central ulceration was palpated 8 cm from the anal verge, and it was fixed in the pelvic cavity. In the emergency center, the patient\u2019s body temperature was 38.9 \u00b0C. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 110 mmHg and 70 mmHg respectively, pulse rate was 78 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute.\nLaboratory results were as follows: White blood cell count (23900/\u00b5L; 93.9% of neutrophil), hemoglobin (11.6 g/dL), platelet count (416000/\u00b5L), C-reactive protein (16.14 mg/dL), lipase (9 IU/L), albumin (3.2 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase (265 IU/L), sodium (132 mEq/L), chloride (93 mEq/L), and prothrombin time percentage (73.2%).\nChest X-ray showed a nodule in the right upper lung field. Besides this, there was no active lesion in the lungs. Colonoscopy revealed a huge submucosal mass-like lesion with focal ulceration located 8 to 15 cm from the anal verge. Abdominopelvic CT showed a poorly marginated mass measuring 7.4 cm \u00d7 6.3 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm in size located between the rectum and uterus and separated from the uterus by fat tissues. The mass had focal non-enhancing lesions without lymph node enlargement. To rule out the origin of the mass, the patient underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the operation. MRI revealed an exophytic growing mass with a maximum diameter of 7.2 cm at the right lateral wall of the rectum with an internal cystic portion and hemorrhage, multiple lymph node enlargement at the iliac bifurcations, obturator, and presacral areas, and a 2.2-cm-sized multiseptated cystic mass in the fundus of uterus (Figure ). Positron emission tomography-CT revealed a high possibility of a malignant tissue with a hypermetabolic mass (SUVmax = 15.1) and cystic changes in the rectum, and this lesion was considered to directly invade the adjacent uterus. Multifocal FDG uptake (SUVmax = 4.0) was observed in the left common iliac, perirectal area, and presacral area (Figure ).\nThe tumor was a polypoid mass measuring 10 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 4 cm in size, and it invaded left ovary and salpinx via the serosal membrane (Figure ). No lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion was observed. Microscopically, the tumor was a cellular mass that had a solid growth pattern with few glandular structures and many foci of intratumoral necrosis. Tumor cells had elongated nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures, including atypical ones, were also frequently observed. At the boundary between the tumor and normal tissue, tumor cells were arranged in a palisading pattern, resembling basal cell carcinomas of the skin (Figure ). Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the tumor cells were focally positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, p63, and Pan-CK and were negative for CK20; neuroendocrine markers, such as synaptophysin and CD56; and mesenchymal cell markers, including CD34, CD117, desmin, S100 protein, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 22-year-old woman (height 160 cm; weight 50 kg; BMI 19.5 kg/m2), gravida 1 para 0, at 16 weeks of gestation (WG) presented to the emergency department complaining of lack of ability to walk and severe weakness of the lower limbs. She had no history of symptoms similar to GS, and there was no family history of neuromuscular diseases. She previously had been in excellent health apart from mild hyperemesis gravidarum, which resolved spontaneously at approximately 10 WG without medication. She had no diarrhea and denied taking herbal medicine, diuretics, laxatives, or glucocorticoids prior to her illness.\nThe patient was in her usual state of health when 5 days back she noticed progressive fatigue and bilateral muscle cramping predominating in lower extremities. The patient noticed knee buckling with frequent falls. Rapidly, within that span, the muscle weakness worsened, and she was confined to bed and unable to mobilize her legs, when she decided to consult in the hospital.\nHer vital signs on examination were heart rate 130/min, blood pressure 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air, and temperature 37\u00b0C. The patient's review of systems was found negative for shortness of breath, cough, and swallowing difficulties. On neurological examination, the patient was alert and well-oriented. Her motor strength in upper limbs was 4/5. Hip flexors, quadriceps, and hamstrings were 1/5 bilaterally; dorsiflexors and plantar flexors were 0/5 bilaterally. Her cranial nerve examination was intact, and the sensation was diminished to touch and pinprick on lower extremities. Cranial and neck muscles were normal, but examination revealed deep tendon reflex to be absent on knees and ankles. The examination of other systems was unremarkable.\nTable shows the initial laboratory data of the patient. Serum level of potassium was 2.2 mmol/L, serum magnesium 0.57 mmol/L, creatinine 68 \u03bcmol/L, and urea 2.8 mmol/L. Serum levels of sodium, total calcium, glucose, cortisol, thyroid, and liver function tests were found to be in normal range. Other blood investigations showed the following: hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL, white cell count 7.5 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL with a neutrophil count 5.9 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, and C-reactive protein 5 mg/dL. Serum creatine phosphokinase level was 55 UI/L.\nHer electrocardiogram (EKG) exhibited sinus tachycardia with inversion of T wave in leads D III, V1 to V4 suggesting hypokalemia.\nShe was assessed by a neurologist, and a diagnosis of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) was suspected. Her time nerve conduction studies (Table ) revealed increased distal motor and sensitive latencies and reduced conduction velocities predominating in low members suggestive of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, in keeping with GBS. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed normal white cell count, protein, and glucose levels. The infectious and autoimmune screen was nonrevealing, and a fetal ultrasound scan showed an ongoing pregnancy at the age of 16 weeks and 6 days.\nShe was then shifted to ICU, and the next day, a course of IV immunoglobulins (0.4 g/kg per day for 5 days) was started, but this therapy resulted in a very poor effect. She was also given a continuous potassium supplementation in form of potassium chloride infusion (130 mmol/day) and intravenous magnesium chloride (40 mmol/day) under cardiac monitoring. Her muscle weakness worsened over 5 days of the treatment and spread to the upper limbs, trunk, and neck muscles. There was no associated difficulty in breathing or swallowing at this time. Serial biochemical evaluations during her hospital stay revealed persistent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia despite parenteral supplements (Fig. ). This was further investigated by urine analysis, which showed the potassium to be 51.5 mmol/L (normal range 16\u201383), chloride: 91 mmol/L (normal range 73\u2013167), calcium: 29 mg/L (normal range 66\u2013200 mg/L), and creatinine: 11.5 mmol/L (normal range 3.5\u201323). Arterial blood gas analysis was performed with the patient breathing room air, which showed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48, HCO3 37.3, PaCO2 43.5). She also had increased plasma renin activity (2.6 ng/mL/h; normal range 0.12\u20131.59) and serum plasma aldosterone (720 ng/dL; normal range 80\u2013365). Under the presenting circumstances, a tubulopathy causing renal potassium loss was considered. Based on the findings of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension, severe hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, a diagnosis of GS was suspected. This diagnosis was ascertained with the sequencing of the implicated gene, which confirmed GS as a heterozygous mutation in SLC12A3.\nIt was decided to reinforce ion supplementation, so potassium and magnesium supplements were increased to respectively 195 and 60 mmol/day.\nOn day 7 of her hospitalization, her condition deteriorated, and her tidal volume and minute volume decreased with swallowing difficulty. Oxygen saturation was 90% at 10 L/min delivered via a mask. To prevent hypoxemia and avoid emergency intubation, she was intubated and ventilated on controlled mandatory ventilation mode, and her vital parameters (electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature) were monitored. At this point, hypokalemia of 1.9 mmol/L was evident along with magnesium 0.43 mmol/L. Periodic fetal evaluation documented fetal well-being and normal size fetus with normal liquor and Doppler.\nOn day 8, the hemodynamic status worsened and the patient experienced prolonged hypotension and intermittent episodes of bradycardia, which occurred spontaneously, without relation to vagal maneuvers, such as endotracheal suctioning. She required vigorous volume replacement with normal saline and the use of vasopressor (Norepinephrine infusion) to maintain her mean arterial blood pressure up to 65 mmHg. EKG examination showed sinus bradycardia with the rate of 45 and prolonged QT interval. Echocardiographic and Doppler assessment failed to reveal any abnormalities in myocardial morphology or function.\nOn day 9, spontaneously fetal demise was observed, and the patient developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). She underwent electrical cardioversion (200 J biphasic), which restored sinus rhythm. Serum level of potassium was 1.5 mmol/L, and serum magnesium was 0.4 mmol/L. In view of the recent clinical deterioration, the use of a potassium-sparing diuretic or aldosterone antagonist was discussed, but this approach could result in hypovolemia and possibly worsen the hemodynamic status. Spironolactone was finally administered to this patient (100 mg/day). Subsequently, she continued to present repeated VF on the same day, which was complicated by a refractory cardiac arrest despite advanced cardiac life support.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n52.382", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe present case is about a 11-year-old Saudi boy who was referred to our service for bilateral adrenalectomy. The patient had been diagnosed by the pediatric endocrinologist with cycling Cushing disease. He presented with a history of rapid weight gain, decreased school performance and emotional disturbances in the previous 18 months. These complaints came in cycles, each lasting 2-4 months before the patient returned to normal. Adrenal ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed normal adrenal glands, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also showed normal pituitary and hypothalamic area. During one of these cycles, his weight increased by 4 kg, blood pressure was 140/100 and he exhibited the typical signs of Cushing's disease. Blood work confirmed Cushing's disease. His serum cortisol at 1 PM was elevated at 16.6 mcg/dL. Electrolytes showed sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 4 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, total CO2 27, blood urea nitrogen 9 mg/dL and creatinine 0.3 mg/dL. 24 h urine for free cortisol was high at 542 mcg/24 h (normal 5-55 mcg/24 h). At 2 months later, the patient presented with a third episode and was admitted for a full work-up. Urine free cortisol was elevated at 350 mcg/24 h, at midnight serum cortisol was 19.9 mcg/dL and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was <4 pg/ml. Am cortisol was 15.7 mcg/dL and ACTH was 5.4 pg/ml. The patient was subjected to small and high doses of dexamethasone suppression tests (1 mg and 5 mg respectively) but there was no change in cortisol or ACTH serum levels. These findings confirmed a diagnosis of Cushing's disease of adrenal origin and its cyclic nature presented Carney's complex syndrome as a possibility. Further investigations to exclude Endocrine and cardiac tumors as part of Carney's complex included ultrasound of the thyroid and echocardiography which were normal. Ultrasound of the testes showed bilateral diffuse macro-calcification as well as 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 cm hypo-echoic mass within the left testicle, which strengthened the diagnosis of Carney's complex. The patient had no abnormal skin rash and the family history was negative for any endocrine problems. Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis on our patient did not show the known mutation in Carney's complex (PRKAR1A) which is found in only 50% of those patients.\nBilateral adrenalectomy was the treatment of choice in this patient. The plan was to start with right laparoscopic adrenalectomy and proceed to left adrenalectomy with the possibility of converting to open. The patient underwent a successful simultaneous bilateral adrenalectomy; the operative time was 3 h and 30 min. The estimated blood loss was 50 ml. The patient resumed his diet and ambulated on the 1st post-operative day and was discharged from hospital on the 2nd post-operative day. The post-operative course was smooth and uneventful and he was started on replacement therapy post-operatively. At 3 months later, he was doing well with a remarkable improvement in his behavior and school performance.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nWe report a case of a 38-year-old man who first attended the emergency room in August 2017 presenting with blood stained vomit and diffuse epigastric pain.\nHe had no relevant medical history but described a loss of 20 kg in 2006, for which he had not sought medical attention. At that time, his approximate weight was 76 kg, although no records were found. He started vomiting after dinner and eventually stopped eating. Those symptoms were related by the patient to the stressful situation he was living in his workplace, with problems with his superior and some fellows that eventually led to the patient quitting his job. Ever since he has been unemployed and living in the family home, the weight and frequency of vomiting remained stable until shortly before he attended the emergency department. In , a visual representation of weight and body mass index (BMI) through the most relevant events is displayed in a timeline.\nAfter ruling out life-threatening conditions, he was referred to internal medicine for additional tests [height (H): 167.5 cm, weight (W): 51.3 kg, BMI: 18.3 kg/m2]. Blood analysis revealed an increased serum amylase concentration (137 U/L). The abdominal ultrasound and the gastroscopy showed no pathological findings. The computed tomography (CT) scan, however, described a 9.2\u00b0 aortomesenteric angle (), and a diagnosis of SMAS was made based upon these findings.\nSurgical treatment was suggested, but as it was not clear whether the SMAS was the cause of the symptom, it was advocated for a conservative course. The patient was referred to gastroenterology and nutrition departments for follow-up, and symptomatic treatment was established with oral nutritional supplements and analgesia. In March, as he appeared to be unable to gain weight, it was decided to start nasojejunal (NJ) nutrition.\nA month later, he was first referred to endocrinology in order to rule out an ED, and subsequently to the Eating Disorders Unit, where on the first psychiatric assessment, cluster A personality traits were described. Unfortunately, despite NJ nutrition, due to continued weight loss and vomiting persistence, he had to be shortly admitted at the hospital, delaying psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. After 5 days, where several follow-up tests were conducted (with normal laboratory test, abdominal radiography, and ultrasound results), he was discharged home with joint evaluation and ongoing management by psychiatry, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and nutrition.\nDuring the first psychiatric follow-up visits, a complete anamnesis of the most relevant clinical and biographical data was recorded. He is the youngest of three brothers and sisters. Their parents got divorced in his early childhood, and he has always lived with his mother. His father died 7 years ago of lung cancer, but they were never close. He was described by his family as having a \u201cpeculiar\u201d personality; he is sensitive, and he does not take criticism well. The patient described himself as a lonely and shy person. He has had difficulties since early adulthood developing intimate relationships. He is reluctant to confide in others or reveal personal information even to his family. Thus, reference to dysfunctional schizoid personality traits was made through his biography, and supported by the results of the Symptom Checklist 90-R test, a diagnosis of a schizoid personality disorder was made. The eating behavior\u2013related tests, however, were not supportive of an ED diagnosis (Eating Attitudes Test score, 15; Body Shape Questionary score, 39).\nEven though he firmly maintained that he was following medical recommendations and denied vomits, his weight continued steadily to diminish to a nadir of 39.3 kg. Consequently, he was soon after readmitted at the Nutrition Department. During this hospital stay in May, psychiatric consultation was requested, and under the presumption of an ED, the patient was transferred to the Psychiatric Ward for closer monitoring. Both the patient and his family denied an eating behavior problem and insisted on an organic origin of the weight loss, denying any psychological aspects to his illness; therefore, he demanded and was granted a voluntary discharge within hours.\nFrom May to August 2018, his weight ranged from 46 to 42 kg. Once his body weight started once again to decrease, he acknowledged self-induced vomiting and agreed to a new hospital admission at the Psychiatric Ward. At this point, his weight was 42.5 kg, and his BMI was 15.24 kg/m2. He was hospitalized from September 10 to October 24, being finally diagnosed with an unspecified feeding and eating disorder (USFED) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 307.50) as body image disturbances were never reported by the patient.\nIn the course of that time, he gained 8.8 kg. During the hospital admission, olanzapine up to 10 mg/d was introduced to regulate sleep patterns and decrease anxiety levels, as the patient referred vomiting to control anxiety. At the same time, anxiolytic (lorazepam 3 mg/day) and antidepressant (fluoxetine 20 mg/day) treatment was added with good tolerance. As he started to increase oral intake, enteral nutrition was gradually decreased until it was finally suspended on October 3. The therapeutic plan during admission consisted of psychoeducation and progressive exposure to food, in order to modify the restrictive eating behavior that has led to chronic malnutrition. At discharge (W: 35.4 kg, BMI: 18.3 kg/m2), he started attending daily an Eating Disorders Day Care Program, where he continues until the present day. Throughout the follow-up visits, a psychotherapeutic intervention was carried, both at personal and group levels, jointly by the nutritionist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. His weight remains stable at 55 to 57 kg, and restrictive and purgative behaviors have decreased progressively during these months.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n58.724", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 15-year-old male complained of strong fatigue after intense exercise since childhood. He had no remarkable medical history apart from allergic rhinitis. After entering high school, he often felt unwell, especially in the morning, and frequently missed classes. He was diagnosed as having orthostatic dysregulation and prescribed amezinium metilsulfate 10 mg/day, but his symptoms persisted. Eight days after the start of treatment he was switched to etilefrine 5 mg/day. However, his fatigue progressively worsened. He was found vomiting and unresponsive after collapsing in the bathroom on the eighth night following the prescription change and taken to the hospital by his family. In the emergency room he exhibited mild consciousness disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V4M6) and complained of right lower abdominal pain. Laboratory tests (blood and urine), whole-body computed tomography, and head magnetic resonance imaging did not indicate any abnormalities (serum creatinine level 1.0 mg/dL, uric acid level 7.2 mg/dL). His conscious state and abdominal pain were improved on the next day, but his blood pressure gradually increased from 100/60 to 180/80 mm Hg and his serum creatinine level rose from 1.0 to 5.5 mg/dL during 5 days of admission. He was then transferred to our institution for the treatment of AKI and severe hypertension.\nAt the time of admission to our hospital the patient was fully conscious and alert. His body temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, blood pressure was 161/98 mm Hg, heart rate was 83 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min. His height was 174 cm and his body weight was 54 kg. Physical examination detected no signs of dehydration, rash, or other abnormalities of the neck, chest, abdomen, or extremities. He had been taking loratadine 10 mg/day for his allergic rhinitis for several months. Both loratadine and etilefrine had been discontinued upon admission to the previous hospital. There was no family history of kidney dysfunction, and he reported no episodes of intense exercise other than daily commuting by bicycle to school. No alcohol consumption, smoking, or illegal drug use were reported. His laboratory data at the time of transfer to our hospital are summarized in Table . Urinalysis showed mild proteinuria (0.66 g/gCr) and elevation of the tubulointerstitial injury marker \u03b22 microglobulin (1,498 \u03bcg/L). Hematuria was not observed. His serum level of uric acid was low at 3.2 mg/dL and his fractional excretion of uric acid was high at 49.7%. Laboratory markers of rhabdomyolysis, diabetes mellitus, infection, and collagen diseases such as creatine phosphokinase, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, and autoimmune antibodies were all within normal range. An electrocardiogram disclosed left anterior hemiblock and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay that had been detected when he was an elementary school student. A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound echography showed bilateral mild kidney swelling with increased renal cortical echogenicity (Fig. ). No stenotic lesions were detected in the aorta or renal arteries, although the resistance index of the intrarenal arteries was slightly high (left 0.69, right 0.69), indicating a circulatory disturbance in the renal microvessels. Hydronephrosis and renal calcification were absent. An ultrasound-guided kidney biopsy performed 3 days after arrival at our hospital showed mild interstitial edema, vascular endothelial cell swelling in the renal interlobular arterioles, and no obvious signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (Fig. ). Treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of extracellular fluids and nicardipine gradually improved his kidney function and hypertension. His serum uric acid level decreased to 1.0 mg/dL (Fig. ), and his fractional excretion of uric acid was at 55.9% at 10 days after admission. He was ultimately diagnosed as having AKI with RHUC and discharged 12 days after transfer to our hospital. Hypouricemia was found in his parents and a sister, indicating a hereditary condition. However, genetic screening did not detect any known causative RHUC mutations on URAT1/SLC22A12 or GLUT9/SLC2A9\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 23-yr-old woman with type 2 DM and Graves' disease has revisited to the Department of Emergency of Gyeongsang National University Hospital due to nausea, generalized weakness, polyuria and weight loss of 5 kg for 7 days in October 2003 since she was discharged from our hospital three weeks before. She was previously diagnosed as type 2 DM in 1996, and recently started insulin treatment to improve glycemic control due to persistently elevated HbA1c irrespective of oral administration of hypoglycemic agents. Three years before, she had taken propylthiouracil for hyperthyroid Graves' disease for 2 yr. In May 2003, she was diagnosed as relapse of hyperthyroidism at a local clinic and referred to our hospital for management of thyrotoxicosis refractory to usual dosage of propylthiouracil, 300 mg/day and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. She had 7.9 mM/L fasting blood glucose, 1.07 nM/L C-peptide (reference range [RR], 0.1-0.83), 222 mM/L fructosamine (RR, 205-285), 8.3% HbA1c (RR, 4.5-5.6) and 0.01 mU/L TSH and 2.02 pM/L free T3 on thryoid function tests. At that time, Her weight was 54 kg and height was 147 cm (body mass index, 25.0 kg/m2). Her thyroid had the volume of about 40 g and it looked diffusely enlarged and rubbery consistency on palpation. The technetium-99m (Tc-99m) thyroid scan revealed marginally increased and somewhat irregular uptake (3.8%). As from hospitalization, the patient had oral administration of relatively high dose of methimazole (60 mg daily), propranolol (160 mg daily) and 12 drops of Lugol's solution (three times a day) for 14 days, and consecutively lithium carbonate (900 mg daily) for 14 days because of persisting tachycardia (>110/ min), dyspnea on exertion and still high concentration of free T3 (4.44 pM/L). She was discharged with receiving methimazole (60 mg daily) and beta-blocker ().\nShe had no family history of thyroid disease, but both parents have been suffering from type 2 DM. She denied ingestion of any drugs including alcohol or excessive consumption of fizzy drinks these days. She also has been adhering to administration of antithyroid drug, beta-blocker and insulin (0.5 units/kg/day) since being discharged. On physical examination, the patient had 143/89 mmHg blood pressure, 36.8\u2103 body temperature, 22/min respiration rate, and 121/min pulse rate. She looked acutely ill, and had slightly tremulous, warmhands, and decreased skin turgor and dried tongue. She was 48 kg weight and body mass index 22.2 kg/m2. Exophthalmos was not present. The abdomen was soft and flat, and liver and spleen were not palpable.\nOn admission, her laboratory findings were as follows; hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, WBC 8.65\u00d7109/L (segmented neutrophil 58%, lymphocyte 29%), platelet 398\u00d7109/L, total protein 65 g/L, albumin 32 g/L, ALP 3.47 ukat/L, AST 0.42 ukat/L, ALT 0.6 ukat/L, BUN 9.2 mM/L and creatinine 88.7 \u00b5M/L. Levels of blood glucose (32.7 mM/L) and fructosamine (396 mM/L) were elevated. Her serum electrolytes and blood gas parameters were as follows: sodium 144.1 mM/L, potassium 5.4 mM/L, chloride 102 mM/L, calcium 2.5 mM/L, phosphorus 1.0 mM/L, pH 7.32, pCO2 35 mmHg, pO2 98 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mM/L. The fasting serum C-peptide was 0.44 nM/L. Serum anion gap was 20.9 and osmolarity was calculated as 321 mosm/kg. Amylase and lipase levels were normal and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Thyroid function tests revealed that the patient had more aggravated hyperthyroid state; 0.01 mU/L TSH, 2.78 pM/L free T3 and 45.38 pM/L free T4 (RR, 11.41-23.08) than when she was hospitalized two weeks before (0.12 mU/L TSH, 1.41 pM/L free T3 and 30.26 pM/L free T4). TSH-receptor antibody level was 26.3 IU/L (RR, <1) and antimicrosomal antibody was 29.3 U/mL (RR, <60). The Tc-99m scan showed still enlarged thyroid with more increased uptake 6.5% than previous uptake scan (3.8%) performed taking propylthiouracil two months before. Based on above results, the patient was diagnosed as HHS accompanying mild ketosis on type 2 DM and aggravated Graves' hyperthyroidism. We treated her with intravenous insulin injection and large volume of intravenous fluid administration. And also, she took high dose of methimazole (90 mg daily, six times a day) and beta-blockers. On the second day, nausea and generalized weakness have been improved.\nAt two months after acute presentation, we measured levels of C-peptide after 75 g glucose loading; 0 min (0.12 nM/L), 30 min (0.74 nM/L), 60 min (1.02 nM/L), 90 min (1.49 nM/L) and 120 min (1.32 nML). Throughout follow-ups for 2 months, she took insulin (0.9 units/kg/day), metformin (1,500 mg daily) and methimazole (45 mg daily).

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 32-year-old overweight male with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes presented to an urban, university hospital ED with a chief complaint of palpitations, shortness of breath, light-headedness, and \u201cfeeling ill.\u201d He had seen his primary care physician twice in the previous weeks for similar symptoms, and he had started an exercise program to address his new-onset diabetes. After an unsuccessful attempt to see his primary care physician again that day, the patient came to the ED for care. The triage nurse charted the patient\u2019s chief complaint as \u201cchest pain with shortness of breath for one week increased with exertion\u201d and recorded a heart rate at 140. The remaining vital signs at triage were a blood pressure of 128/71 mm/Hg, respirations of 28, and a temperature of 35 degrees C. Room air pulse oximetry was recorded at 95%. At the time of his arrival, the ED was over 250% of capacity (patients/beds), and the institution was on ambulance diversion. Since all 40 licensed ED beds were occupied, the patient was placed on a gurney in one of several narrow hallways within the ED. Twenty patients were already receiving hallway care when the patient presented to the ED, and another 40 were in the waiting room. The triage nurse immediately performed an electrocardiogram (EKG) per ED policy, which was immediately reviewed by an attending physician on duty at that time. This physician noted there was no ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on the EKG and, at the request of a nurse, wrote orders for a basic lab panel. As it was the end of shift, this physician had no further involvement with the patient and did not mention his/her involvement to the next attending. On average, attending physicians in this ED screen as many as 25 patient EKGs for STEMI while providing direct supervision to an additional 30 patients during a 10-hour shift.\nFour hours after triage, the patient was formally evaluated by an off-service PGY1 (post-graduate year one) resident. The resident was aware that an attending physician had already viewed the EKG and ordered labs. The resident charted the results, including the comments from the EKG, and performed a history and physical. The prior attending was off-shift, thus the resident presented the case to a new attending physician. At that time the ED remained crowded, with all its resources overwhelmed. The oncoming attending physician had immediately become overwhelmed with critically ill and injured patients and was repeatedly confined to the resuscitation room with medical or trauma codes. During the first 2 hours of the shift, this new attending physician performed over 10 initial EKG screenings. At 5 hours post-arrival, the resident was able to present the case to the new ED attending physician, who then examined the patient in the hallway. The history obtained by the resident noted the patient never actually had chest pain, and this was confirmed by the attending physician. The point-of-care glucose was 463 mg/dL, and the initial diagnostic impression was probable hyperglycemia with dehydration. Because the patient was in the hallway, there was no formal location to maintain his paper records, and the EKG was no longer available for review. This attending physician did know that, per ED policy, a patient with dyspnea and chest pain would have automatically received a triage EKG and assumed it had been reviewed by the prior attending physician. If the initial screening review of the EKG had been concerning, the patient would have been moved out of the hallway to a monitored licensed bed, or \u201cdoubled up\u201d in the central treatment area of the ED. Six hours after presentation the patient\u2019s laboratory studies returned with results consistent with the initial impression of possible mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and dehydration. The blood glucose was 417 mg/dL, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, and an anion gap of 15. Venous blood gas pH was 7.34. PCO2 was mildly decreased. Other labs were within normal limits. The patient was treated with 3 liters of IV normal saline, as well as 5 units IV and 5 units subcutaneous regular insulin. A chest radiograph was performed and was normal. Oxygen saturation was checked multiple times and ranged from 95 to 98% saturation on room air.\nAfter therapy, the patient\u2019s glucose decreased to the 200 mg/dL range, and a repeat chemistry panel showed normal bicarbonate with no anion gap. The patient\u2019s heart rate ranged from 66 to 114 for much of the stay in the ED, and by time of discharge was normal. The dyspnea had improved. The patient passed an oral trial of fluids, felt improved, and wanted to return home. Because this was a new onset DKA, albeit mild, an informal discussion was held with the hospitalist about admission. The hospitalist, based on the quick resolution of symptoms and patient\u2019s access to his primary care physician, recommended outpatient management. The patient was then discharged home with the final diagnosis of hyperglycemia, mild DKA, dyspnea secondary to metabolic acidosis, and dehydration. A more aggressive regimen for his diabetes was prescribed, and home equipment for self-monitoring ordered. Close follow-up with his primary care doctor was specified. The patient was discharged 8 hours after arrival in the ED. Discharge vital signs were 154/86 mm/Hg, heart rate 94, respiratory rate 20, temperature 37 degrees C, and 98% room air saturation. He never occupied a licensed ED bed and was never on a cardiac monitor, as these were all in use.\nTwo days later, the patient developed severe shortness of breath; therefore, 911 was called and EMS activated. The patient had a cardiac arrest en route to the same hospital from which he was discharged two days earlier. Resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful, and the patient expired. An autopsy was performed and showed multiple acute and chronic pulmonary emboli as the primary cause of death. The initial EKG was retrospectively interpreted by a cardiology attending physician as showing \u201cright axis deviation, multiple ST and T-wave changes suspicious for anterior ischemia.\u201d The autopsy did not show coronary artery disease or evidence of myocardial infarction.\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n6.0", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 12-year-old Caucasian male patient presented with a diagnosis of unspecified DM. At the age of 8, it was incidentally discovered that the patient had fasting hyperglycemia (7.7 mmol/L) without clinical symptoms. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed glucose levels at baseline and 120 min of 6.6 and 12.1 mmol/L, respectively. Other findings included the absence of glycosuria and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.4%. The patient was diagnosed with DM type 1 (DM1) and prescribed Actrapid HM (3 U/day; NovoNordisk A/S, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark) and Protaphane HM (2 U/day; NovoNordisk A/S). The daily glucose levels were 4.0\u22128.6 mmol/L and his HbA1c levels ranged between 6.6%\u20137.7% for 4 years.\nAt the time of admission (12-years-old), the body mass index and height both expressed with standard deviation (SD) were 17.3\u00b10.21 kg/m2 and 148.6\u00b10.28 cm, respectively. No signs of acanthosis were observed. The daily insulin dose was 5 U (0.13 U/kg), blood glucose fluctuated from 4.1 to 8.2 mmol/L, and glycated hemoglobin was 7.0%. There were no signs of dyslipidemia. The OGTT demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance (6.5 mmol/L at baseline, 8.9 mmol/L on 120 min), pronounced hyperinsulinemia (immunoreactive insulin [IRI] from 321.3 mU/L up to 442.1 mU/L), and IR (Caro index 0.02 [normal >0.2], homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 92.82 [normal <3.4]).\nGlutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, insulin, and tyrosine phosphatase antibodies were negative. Typing for HLA-protective haplotypes revealed the presence of DM1 protective haplotypes DRB1*1313, DQA1*0103, and DQB1*0602-8. The patient had no family history of glucose metabolism disorders ().\nConsidering the mild course of the disease during the previous 4 years, despite pronounced IR, the GCK nucleotide sequence was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. A heterozygous mutation (p.E256K) was identified in GCK (MIM #138079, reference sequence NM_000162.3). After the genetic testing, insulin therapy was cancelled and metformin (1,000 mg/day) was prescribed.\nThe patient\u2019s parents also had molecular genetic testing done. The nucleotide sequence of exon 7 of GCK (Gene ID 2645) was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. There were no mutations in the nucleotide sequence of exon 7. Because of ethical considerations, genetic paternity test was not performed.\nA year later, patient parameters were assessed: 1) height (SD), 155.4 cm (0.05); 2) body weight, 44 kg; 3) body mass index (SD), 18.22 kg/m2 (0.0); and 4) Tanner development, stage 4. The blood glucose ranged from 6.4 to 10.1 mmol/L. HbA1c level was 6.9%. According to his OGTT results, there was deterioration of glucose metabolism (glycemia after 2 h was 15.4 mmol/L), hyperinsulinemia increased (up to 508.9 mU/L) and IR (HOMA index 114.26, Matsuda index 0.15) (). During a mixed-meal glucose tolerance test, the glycemic rate was high. However, daily fluctuations of the blood glucose were between 6.4 and 10.1 mmol/L, which corresponded with an HbA1c of <7%.\nA hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test, the gold standard for the study of IR, was performed for the patient.\nThe rate of insulin infusion in this patient was 1.0 mU/kg/min, and the M-index (glucose disposal rate) was 2.85 mg/kg/min. For adults, a normal M-index is >6.0 mg/kg/min, and a value <2 mg/kg/min indicates a moderate IR. There is no established normal range for adolescents. Even taking into account the physiological IR of adolescence, we considered these results to confirm IR in our patient. A hyperinsulinemic\u2013euglycemic clamp test confirmed the presence of IR in this patient.\nOwing to the increased IR, metformin dose was increased to 1,700 mg/day. After 6 months from increasing the dose, the glycemic profile showed no significant improvement of glycemic control. The HbA1c level was 6.6% and an OGTT demonstrated increased glycemia and IRI after 60 and 120 min without significant changes in IR (HOMA index was 112.86, Matsuda index 0.12) ().\nThe following genes were analyzed on an Ion Torrent sequencing system with a custom DM-HI (monogenic forms of diabetes, hyperinsulinism) AmpliSeq panel: GCG, GLUD1, WFS1, HNF1A, GCK, INS, HNF1B, ABCC8, HNF4A, RFX6, PTF1A, NEUROD1, AKT2, ZFP57, INSR, EIF2AK3, PPARG, PAX4, PDX1, GLIS3, KCNJ11, SLC16A1, FOXP3, BLK, CEL, KLF11, SCHAD and GCGR (total coverage 96.5%). The analysis showed the presence of the same p.E256K mutation in GCK gene. Thus, the diagnosis of MODY2 can be confirmed by performing molecular genetic testing twice. There were no mutations in other tested genes, including INSR and PPARG. We did not test for mutations in other genes such as those responsible for lipodystrophy-associated insulin resistant diabetes mellitus, including gene LMNA, because there were no clinical signs of lipodystrophy.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n52.716", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nIn August 2018, a 58-year-old man [height: 169 cm, body weight: 56 kg, and body mass index (BMI): 19.6 kg/m2] was admitted to our emergency department with upper abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia and metabolic acidosis. He had lived with type 2 diabetes for 16 years and had no history of any allergy, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or renal diseases. Five months prior to admission, he initiated subcutaneous insulin administration (SIA) with the biphasic insulin analogue aspart after failure of sitagliptin and metformin therapies (HbA1c: 8.07% [65 mmol/mol]). Glycaemic control did not improve (HbA1c: 10.2% [88 mmol/mol]; total daily insulin dose was 20 UI), and aspart administration caused mild allergic symptoms. Aspart was then substituted by biphasic human insulin in which the total daily insulin dose increased up to 37 units. However, 5 months after the initiation of these regimens, he developed a pruritic wheal, especially distinct at the injection site (Fig. a). Pruritic wheals appeared within 10 min of injection and lasted over 24 h. The levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c deteriorated to 8.6 mmol/litre and 11.2% (99 mmol/mol), respectively. An allergy to insulin was then suspected. A skin prick test was carried out with different types of insulin [insulin aspart (NovoRapid\u00ae), recombinant human insulin (Actrapid\u00ae and Insulatard\u00ae), insulin glargine (Lantus Solostar\u00ae), and insulin lispro (Humalog\u00ae, Humalog mix\u00ae)] in which the test was positive for all of these types. Two days before admission, he stopped SIA because of an allergic reaction and was treated with anti-allergic drugs.\nOne day later, he experienced weakness and upper abdominal pain. On admission, clinical examination revealed a dehydrated patient with a heart rate (HR) of 130 beats/minute, a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and a systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 150/90 mmHg. He was tachypnoeic and dyspnoeic with a respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths/minute. He had hot and dry skin without pruritic wheals, isochoric pupils, and had no focal neurological deficit. He had normal breath sounds and a soft and non-tender abdomen. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 130 beats/minute. Echocardiography revealed normal chamber size and systolic function, without valvular lesions. Laboratory tests revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an arterial blood pH of 6.984, bicarbonate of 2.5 mmol/litre and a serum anion gap (AG) of 26.4 mmol/litre. The arterial PO2 and PCO2 levels were 164.3 mmHg and 10.5 mmHg, respectively. Serum glucose was 20.79 mmol/litre, serum lactate was 1.5 mmol/litre, and urinary ketone was 11.44 mmol/litre. Serum potassium, sodium and chloride levels were 5.7 mmol/litre, 137.4 mmol/litre and 114.2 mmol/litre, respectively. Liver and renal function tests were normal, and there was a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 14.1 \u00d7 109/l. He was admitted to our emergency ICU with a diagnosis of severe DKA in a patient with type 2 diabetes with an insulin allergy. Intravenous (IV) fluids, bicarbonate and potassium replacement and intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were initiated. During the first 12 h, he received an initial 1 litre IV bolus of normal saline (0.9% NaCl) in the first hour, followed by a rate of 250 mL/hour, with 26 mmol of potassium chloride added per litre of normal saline. He also received 500 mL of sodium bicarbonate 1.4% solution over 2 h and then repeated as needed. However, his tachypnoea (35 breaths/minute) and metabolic acidosis persisted (arterial blood pH of 7.192, bicarbonate of 4.0 mmol/litre, PO2 of 156.1 mmHg, PCO2 of 10.3 mmHg, AG of 24.69 mmol/litre), prompting the initiation of CVVHDF using the Prismaflex\u00ae system (Gambro Lundia AB, Sweden) at the following settings: blood flow, 160 mL/minute; replacement volume, 1200 mL/hour; and dialysate, 1200 mL/hour. After 24 h of fluid resuscitation (6500 mL), he was haemodynamically stable and had 3500 mL of urinary output. However, he developed a decreased level of consciousness, agitation, and fatigue of his respiratory muscles. He was intubated for airway protection and was mechanically ventilated for respiratory support. Furthermore, hypotension (HR and BP were 120 beats/minute and 80/40 mmHg, respectively) occurred after intubation. A bolus of normal saline (1000 mL) was provided, and norepinephrine was administered at a rate of 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/minute. Haemodynamic stability was recovered after 1 h, with a HR of 110 beats/minute, BP of 120/60 mmHg, and measured CVP value of 8 cmH2O. Arterial blood gases revealed a worsening metabolic acidosis with an arterial blood pH of 7.022, bicarbonate of 2.5 mmol/litre and a serum AG of 25.75 mmol/litre. Renal function declined with a serum creatinine level of 198 \u03bcmol/litre. Serum glucose, potassium, sodium and chloride levels were 23.32 mmol/litre, 4.35 mmol/litre, 140.5 mmol/litre and 116.6 mmol/litre, respectively. CVVHDF and IV fluids and potassium replacement were continued. Although haemodynamic and respiratory stabilities were maintained, metabolic acidosis persisted. Further skin prick testing with different types of insulin [insulin aspart (NovoRapid\u00ae), recombinant human insulin (Actrapid\u00ae, Insulatard\u00ae, Mixtard\u00ae, Humulin R\u00ae, and Humulin N\u00ae), and insulin glargine (Lantus\u00ae)] only showed positivity to two (aspart, human) of these types. However, the intradermal test with these types was positive (the time of testing as shown in Additional file ). A 40 mg dose of methylprednisolone sodium succinate and 10 mg of diphenhydramine were given in the event of the possible occurrence of a severe allergic reaction, and continuous IV infusion of recombinant human insulin was initiated at a rate of 0.1 units/kg/hour. Approximately 60 min after continuous IV infusion of insulin, he developed hypotension without any signs or symptoms of allergic reactions of the skin and mucosa, and the HR was 115 beats/minute and BP was 80/40 mmHg. Infusion of insulin was temporarily stopped followed by intravenous epinephrine administration at a starting rate of 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/minute in addition to an IV bolus of 1000 mL of normal saline. He regained haemodynamic stability after 30 min, including a HR of 110 beats/minute and a BP of 120/70 mmHg, and did not require any additional administration of epinephrine after 5 h. Continuous IV infusion of recombinant human insulin at a rate of 0.1 units/kg/hour continued without any events such as signs or symptoms of allergic reactions and hypotension.\nOn day 5 of follow-up, ketonaemia, metabolic acidosis (arterial blood pH of 7.465, bicarbonate of 18.4 mmol/litre and AG of 12.73 mmol/litre), and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine of 108 \u03bcmol/litre) had almost resolved, and CVVHDF was withdrawn. He did not require vasoconstrictors. Continuous IV infusion of recombinant human insulin continued and was adjusted according to blood glucose levels measured with a portable blood glucose meter. He was extubated on day 7 and transitioned from continuous IV insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin (combined regular human insulin with insulin glargine) administration on day 14. He was discharged on day 21 with SIA (combined regular human insulin with insulin glargine) in combination with an oral antidiabetic drug (sitagliptin and metformin). Three months later, glycaemic control was gradually restored (HbA1c: 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]; total daily insulin dose was up to 44 UI); he still appeared to have mild allergic symptoms, such as local erythaema and swelling, especially distinct at the injection site of insulin glargine (Fig. b).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n65.03", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 17-year-old South Asian man was referred to our department for recurrent episodes of generalized muscle weakness, fatigue and cramps from the age of two years. Hypokalemia was initially detected at the first episode and he was treated for periodic hypokalemic paralysis. Before the age of 12 years, these episodes were mild, readily improved with ringer lactate and potassium chloride by his treating physician and occurred only twice a year. Beyond the age of 12 years, these episodes gradually worsened in frequency and intensity to the point that they were refractory to previously administered therapies and sometimes required hospitalization.\nHis symptoms were aggravated by physical activity and hot weather, and were associated with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, paresthesias and occasional painless non-bloody diarrhea. He denied the use of any medication, including laxatives and diuretics. He also had a history of short stature and poor weight gain. His birth history was unremarkable but developmental landmarks were delayed. There was no family history of renal salt-wasting syndromes or delayed puberty. However, his parents were first cousins.\nAn examination revealed a thin and lean, but well-oriented adolescent with no acute distress. His height and weight were below the third percentile (weight 30kg; height 147cm). His blood pressure was 95/60mmHg with orthostatic changes. His sexual development was at Tanner Stage II.\nInvestigations at the admitting hospital revealed a normal leukocyte count, platelet count, hemoglobin level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. His urea level was 34mg/dL, creatinine 0.9mg/dL and random blood glucose 105mg/dL. His estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula was 97.9ml/min per 1.73m2. His high blood urea nitrogen level was attributed to mild dehydration due to the hot weather. He was found to have metabolic alkalosis: pH 7.58, HCO3- 33.5, base excess +7.6. His serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 124mmol/L, potassium 2.4mmol/L, calcium 6.5mmol/L and phosphate 3.4mg/dL. His serum magnesium level was not checked at that time. Serum albumin, creatine phosphokinase, free thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and parathyroid hormone levels were normal.\nHe was provisionally diagnosed with periodic hypokalemic paralysis and hypocalcemia. Treatment was started with potassium and calcium supplements. After one month, he showed little improvement and he was referred to our department for further evaluation.\nFurther laboratory tests revealed a low magnesium level (1.2mg/dl) and decreased 24-hour urinary excretion of calcium (25.9mg/24 h). Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were also normal. His level of testosterone was low (0.85ng/mL, normal for his age 2.67 to 10.12ng/mL). Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm and prolonged QT interval. No abnormality was found on an abdominal X-ray, chest X-ray or brain magnetic resonance imaging. A renal ultrasound revealed a prominent pelvicalyceal system. An insulin tolerance test showed normal cortisol and growth hormone response.\nBased on the findings of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension, severe hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria, a diagnosis of GS was made. No organic cause of hypogonadism was established and the sex hormone findings were attributed to delayed puberty. Treatment was started with oral supplementation of potassium, magnesium and calcium along with spironolactone and liberal salt intake. Our patient and his parents were also counseled about delayed puberty.\nA limitation to this case report was that the diagnosis could not be ascertained with sequencing of the implicated gene due to unavailability of genetic sequencing at the presenting hospital (Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Pakistan).\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

His mother had bled from oral mucosa for 3 days because of an unknown reason. Blood tests showed a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) exceeding 70 s (normal: 10.4\u201312.6 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 110.5 s (normal: 74.0\u2013110.0 s). The addition of normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio resulted in complete correction of the coagulation abnormalities, and a coagulation factor deficiency was suspected. The results of factor assay were associated with vitamin K deficiency: the levels of factor II, factor VII, factor IV, and factor X were sharply low, but factor V and factor VIII were within normal ranges. The mother was given vitamin K intravenously, and the oral bleeding stopped after 8 hours. Serum screening for toxicant by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was taken 6 hours after admission and the result showed a bromadiolone level of 126 ng/mL.[ She denied intentional ingestion of any kind of rodenticides. The most likely route of exposure might be ingestion of the food contaminated by bromadiolone.\nThe boy's APGAR scores[ were 2 (Pulse: 2), 5 (Activity: 1;Pulse: 2;Grimace: 1;and Respiratory effort: 1), and 5 (Activity: 1;Pulse: 2;Grimace: 1;Respiratory effort: 1) at 1, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. Blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.249, PCO2of 55.9mmHg, PO2of 32mmHg, and BE of \u22124.2mmol/L. Immediate intubation and resuscitation was necessary. The boy showed poor respiratory effort, decreased muscle tone, and pallor. He was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for further treatment. The patient presented no history of trauma and bleeding diathesis.\nUpon admission, the boy's measurements were as follows: weight 3120 g; length 48 cm; and fronto-occipital head circumference 37 cm. All of these measurements were appropriate for the boy's gestational age. The boy presented with bulging anterior fontanelle, a heart rate of 169 bpm, and blood pressure of 68/40 mmHg. No external signs of spontaneous hemorrhage were noted. The pupils were dilated and fixed to light. Corneal, Moro, and rooting reflexes were absent. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were not found.\nLaboratory tests revealed hemoglobin level of 74 g/L, white blood cell count of 17.57 \u00d7 109/L, and platelet count of 264 \u00d7 109/L. PT exceeded 70 s (upper limit of reference), and aPTT was greater than 150 s (upper limit of reference). Fibrinogen (3.02 g/L) and thrombin time (16.4 s) were normal. Serology assay showed the following values: ALT: 5U/L; Alb: 28 g/L; TBil: 27.4 \u03bcmol/L; Cr: 57 \u03bcmol/L; CK: 353U/L; and CKMB: 6.3 \u03bcg/L.\nThe neonate was treated with vitamin K, fresh-frozen plasma, and red blood cells. His oral mucosa started to bleed at 2 hours after birth. Muscle tone increased at 4 hours after birth. Generalized seizures started on day 1 of life. A head computed tomography showed a severe subdural hematoma causing midline shift, bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. ).

Besides the injured thigh, there was no complaint of pain at any other site. There was no associated injury and any other comorbid conditions. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 37 and no other comorbidities. He had no history of veno-occlusive disease, and all the preoperative laboratory evaluations were normal. Antegrade interlocking nailing was planned as a treatment strategy. He was taken into the operating theatre within 48 h of the trauma after adequate resuscitation. The surgery was carried out under general anaesthesia, with epidural analgesia. The patient was positioned on a fracture table. The well leg was placed in hemilithotomy position in 70\u00b0 flexion and 40\u00b0 abduction, and it was placed on a leg holder. The patient was maintained in this position throughout the procedure. Following closed reduction of the fracture, nailing was attempted. But the failure to obtain acceptable reduction initially increased the surgical time; the intraoperative plan was changed and fixation with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) was performed (fig. ). The total surgical time was 2 h and 30 min. There was 650 ml of blood loss and 1 unit of whole blood was transfused intraoperatively. The patient's arterial blood pressure was maintained by the anaesthetists at 94/60 mm Hg or above throughout the procedure as a preventive measure to reduce bleeding at the operative site. The intraoperative traction was released after 2 h for 5 min. When the procedure was nearing completion, a dose of epidural analgesia was given to relieve the patient of any possible postoperative pain. The patient was shifted to the ward after the completion of surgery.\nIn the postoperative rounds, the distal pulses of the operated extremity were palpable and any neural deficit could not be assessed as the patient was under the effect of epidural analgesia. The well leg was not examined by the surgeon and the nurse. Four hours after the end of surgery, the patient complained of severe pain in the well leg. A tense and firm swelling was found and stretch pain was present (fig. ). On physical examination, there was paraesthesia on the lateral aspect of the foot. A diagnosis of well-leg compartment syndrome was made. An urgent radiograph of the well leg was taken to exclude any bone injury which might have been missed. The radiographs revealed no bone injury, and the patient was treated with an immediate fasciotomy. A double-incision fasciotomy was performed. Vacuum-assisted closure suction was applied over the fasciotomy wound (fig. ). His wounds healed without difficulty and he regained normal strength and sensation in the lower extremity. The patient was discharged on the 20th postoperative day. The fracture united both clinically and radiologically at the 12th week.

She had poorly controlled, post-traumatic right temporal lobe epilepsy but no additional past medical history or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. MRI brain demonstrated multiple areas of gliosis, particularly laterally and anteromedially in the right temporal lobe, the right, and to a lesser degree, left orbitofrontal cortex, with focal white matter loss in the corpus callosum. Video-telemetry was consistent with focal-onset, nondominant mesial temporal or orbitofrontal lobe seizures; semiology consisted of right upper limb and oral motor automatisms preceded by prolonged aura, including olfactory and autonomic features. Generalized convulsive seizures were not observed during this period of recording. Robotic sEEG (Renishaw Neuromate) was undertaken to further localize seizure onset; 13 electrodes were implanted in the right hemisphere in a frontotemporal distribution and 1 in the left orbitofrontal region (Figure ). Routine postinsertion CT demonstrated a small parenchymal hematoma related to the right posterior temporal electrode ((electrode F); entry via middle temporal gyrus, deep contacts in the fusiform gyrus) which was asymptomatic. Over 9 days, a total of 14 stereotyped seizures were recorded (Figure ); all initiated from the right mesial temporal structures starting in the amygdala with rapid spread to the hippocampus and right temporal pole. Apparently uneventful explantation occurred at day 10 on the ward. This was several hours after the last recorded seizure, and prophylactic enoxaparin had been withheld for 48 hours.\nFour hours postexplantation during which time seizures did not occur, the patient experienced severe central chest pain at rest with radiation to the neck and associated dyspnea, diaphoresis, and nausea. Pain responded to glyceryl trinitrate and morphine. She denied headache. Oxygen (O2) saturations were 73% on air, improving to 98% with 3 L O2. There was hemodynamic instability, sinus tachycardia (rate 125/min) and episodic hypotension (minimum systolic 70 mmHg). Cardiorespiratory examination was consistent with pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular (LV) failure, and there were no focal neurological findings or seizures. Electrocardiogram demonstrated new-onset anterolateral T-wave inversion with reciprocal changes in leads II, III, and aVF (Figure A,B). Chest X-ray findings confirmed pulmonary edema (Figure ). Intravenous frusemide was administered, and, given concern regarding the possibility of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), dual antiplatelet therapy was commenced.\nClinical improvement with resolution of chest pain and dyspnea occurred over 24 hours. Troponin level rose from 13 to 33 ng/L. ECG changes resolved, and the coronary angiogram was normal. Antiplatelet therapy was discontinued at 48 hours. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed evidence of moderate LV systolic dysfunction (estimated ejection fraction 40%\u201345%) and hypokinesis of the cardiac apex as well as the anterior and anteroseptum. The right temporal lobe hematoma was again noted on MRI brain at 2 days postexplantation along with right frontal pole edema (Figure ) but there was no extension of the hematoma when compared with the initial postexplantation CT scan. TTE demonstrated improvement in LV systolic function at 4 weeks and near normal function at 6 months.\nFollowing initial concern regarding the possibility of NSTEMI, the diagnosis was revised to takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy (TTS). TTS, also known as \u201cstress-induced cardiomyopathy\u201d and \u201cbroken heart syndrome,\u201d is characterized by LV dysfunction with regional wall abnormalities including apical ballooning and focal wall-motion abnormalities; the end-systole radiological appearance of the left ventricle is said to resemble a Japanese octopus trap (\u201ctakotsubo\u201d). TTS occurs more often in postmenopausal females and at times of emotional and physical stress. The pathogenesis remains uncertain although sympathetic stimulation is key and a link between the insular cortex and central autonomic network recognized. Acute neurological diseases including subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and seizures are well-recognized precipitants for TTS, and an association between TTS and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been proposed. TTS has not previously been recorded in the context of sEEG.\nLevel C evidence for treatment of TTS is available, and management is generally based on guidelines for treatment of acute coronary artery syndrome with particular consideration given to beta-blockers in view of association with elevated catecholamine levels, diuretics for pulmonary edema, and nitroglycerin in LV failure.\nIntracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is well recognized to be a precipitant for TTS, and ICH has been reported to occur in approximately 1% patients undergoing sEEG. The presence of temporal lobe hemorrhage could therefore have been a trigger for TTS. Takosubo syndrome has also been reported several days after convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures, so seizure activity may also have been a contributory factor. While we cannot categorically state that explantation induced TTS in our patient, we consider the timing suggestive although the association has not, to the best of our knowledge, been reported previously. Furthermore, the multiple potential triggers may have contributed to the presentation.\nGiven the potential for overlapping risk factors of seizures and ICH, this case highlights the importance of awareness of TTS in the context of an epilepsy surgery program. We advise early involvement of cardiologists in the care of patients suspected of having TTS and, if clinically safe to do so, prompt neuroimaging to exclude ICH.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?", "output": "### Response:\n3", "task": "calc"}

Continued dyspnea and addition of fever, took him to the emergency room. He had history of hypertension and no history of addiction or diabetes mellitus. At presentation, temperature was 38\u00b0C, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, heart rate 84 beat per minute, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg and oxygen saturation 94%. Heart auscultation indicated early systolic and diastolic murmur. Laboratory test showed a total leukocyte count of 8700 with 90% polymorphs and anemia (Hb 7/5 gr/dl). His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 19 mm/h and his serum level of C-reactive protein was 29 mg/dl. Blood urea, serum creatinin, sodium and potassium were in normal ranges. His chest CT scan demonstrated mild plural effusion in both lungs. In transthoracic echocardiography he had moderate MR and moderate TR with a mobile calcified mass on aorta valve. Transesophageal echocardiography indicated Mitral valve thickening with severe regurgitation and perforation of anterior leaflet; Aortic valve thickening with severe insufficiency and perforation of non-coronary cusp (NCC); mobile mass measuring about 6\u00d77 mm on NCC and mild pericardial effusion posterior to right atrium (). Three sample of blood culture by hourly intervals was negative. After 2 weeks of treatment with vancomycin, ampicillin/sulbactam and gentamicin, there was no improvement in the patient. So, he underwent surgical excision and valves replacement that revealed vegetation on aorta and mitral valves. Pathologic specimen showed severe neutrophilic infiltration with areas of necrosis, granulation tissue, fibrous deposition and bacterial colonization (). Tissue sample was also placed in sterile screw-cap container and drops of sterile saline were added to keep it moist. It was transported to the microbiological laboratory in 15 minutes. The sample was cultured on MacConkey agar and chocolate blood agar and after 48 hours Gram-stained smear showed Gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli which grew as non lactose fermenting colonies. The organism was oxidase negative, catalase positive and non mobile. The isolate was identified as Acinetobacter baumannii complex based on glucose oxidation and Triple Suger Iron (TSI) test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method as per clinical and laboratory standard institute recommendation and based on that, the organism was XDR and was only sensitive to colistin. According to the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, medical treatment of the patient changed to intra-venous colistin and tigecycline.

A typical bowing and anteromedial rotation of the tibia was corrected with tibial shaft osteotomies and Ilizarov fixators of both tibias about 10 years ago []. After these procedures, very slow healing of the bone with multiple revisions due to delayed union was observed.\nThe patient has had pain in both knees for four years, more in the right than in the left knee. Initially, at 6 years of follow-up, approximately 4 years ago, MRI of both knees and pelvic X-ray did not reveal any pathological changes other than a strong coxa vara malformation of both hips (). Pain was described by the patient as start-up pain that disappeared or bettered after walking with full weight bearing for a while. Since about 3 months, the pain began to concentrate on both hips radiating in both knees; the same start-up character of the pain was described. Upon questioning, the patient admitted that he has not been taking his medication regularly the last 6 months.\nClinical examination revealed a patient with athletic build, weighting 53 kg and measuring 155 cm. Hip range of motion was (right side/left side) flexion/extension 120/0/0 and 130/0/0, endo-/exorotation 20/0/5 and 20/0/30, and ab-/adduction 10/0/30 and 15/0/30. Trendelenburg's sign was positive on both sides. The patient complained of pain by abduction and exorotation. The Harris and Oxford hip scores were 86 and 43, respectively. Haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal range except for a low phosphate of 1.7 mg/dL (norm: 2.3\u20134.7) and low potassium of 3.1 mmol/L (norm: 3.5\u20135.1). Radiographs of hips and pelvis () revealed fractures in both femoral necks. An MRI of the pelvis showed an atrophic nonunion of both fractures ().\nTreatment options were discussed with the patient and a conservative treatment was decided on.

She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 9 months ago and was taking antituberculosis therapy. Her height was 163 cm and her weight was 49 kg. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness and a ping-pong ball-sized movable mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.0-cm, round, laminated intraluminal mass with calcification in the cecum (). Colonoscopy revealed fibrotic scar tissue probably due to intestinal tuberculosis in the ascending colon and a web-like stricture in the cecum around a patulous ileocecal valve. In a blind space which was formed by the stricture, a yellowish mass was found (). We could not insert a fiberoptic colonoscope into the cecum, and dilatation was thus performed using a th-rough-the-scope balloon (CRE balloon; Boston Scientific Co., Marlborough, MA, USA) with a diameter of 12 to 15 mm on inflation (). After endoscopic balloon dilatation, the colonoscope was able to pass into the cecum, and a 3.0-cm, yellowish fecaloma was observed. We broke down the fecaloma with a polypectomy snare and grasping forceps. The fecaloma was successfully removed by using a water jet and grasping forceps through the endoscopic procedure (; Supplementary Video 1 online). There was no ulcer in the cecal base.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 47-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of nausea, vomiting and moderate to severe progressive epigastric pain. She reported subjective fever with rigors and chills, loose, watery stools and abdominal fullness. Her past medical history was significant for chronic alcoholism; she drank 6\u20138 beers each day. She had no reported history of cirrhosis.\nOn arrival, her vitals included blood pressure: 120/88 mmHg, pulse:80/minute, respiratory rate:18/minute, temperature:98.6 \u00baF and oxygen saturation: 97% on ambient air. She appeared in mild distress; sclera was slightly jaundiced. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. The abdomen was mildly tender in the epigastric area without guarding and rigidity. Hepatomegaly was also noted. Central nervous system examination was non-focal. Skin showed no erythematous lesions. Laboratory data included haemoglobin 14.2 (12.0\u201315.7 g/dl), leucocyte count 9 (4.5\u201311 \u00d7 103/uL), platelets count 143 (4.5\u201311.0 \u00d7 103/uL), glucose 83(70\u2013105 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen 48(7\u201322 mg/dL), creatinine 2.52(0.50\u20131.50 mg/dL), sodium 129(134\u2013145 mM/L), potassium 2.9(3.5\u20135.1 mM/L), chloride 94(98\u2013112 mM/L), bicarbonate 18(24\u201330 mM/L), anion gap 17(6.0\u201314.0 mM/L), albumin 2.5(3.5\u20135.0 g/dL), total bilirubin 6.3(0.2\u20131.3 mg/dL), AST 71(8\u201340 U/L), ALP 66(39\u2013117 U/L), ALT 128 (7\u201356 U/L), activated PTT 38.1 (23.0\u201331.0 sec) and PT 12.9 (9.5\u201312.0 sec) and lactic acid 2.8 (0.5\u20132.0 mM/L). Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed severe, circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with the involvement of distal esophagus and the first portion of the duodenum in addition to perigastric stranding; findings were reported to be consistent with severe gastritis (). There was also mild mucosal thickening of the transverse and descending colon. The liver was enlarged with fatty infiltration. A small amount of ascites with small left-sided pleural effusion was seen throughout the peritoneum. No obstruction, perforation or intrabdominal abscess was seen. Based on her subtle presentation, physical exam and hemodynamic stability, primary peritonitis was deemed less likely upon initial assessment. Therefore, she was admitted to a medical floor with the provisional diagnoses of alcohol-related gastritis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute kidney injury. She received a 2-litre bolus of intravenous (IV) normal saline and was started on maintenance fluid, IV antiemetics, and IV pantoprazole.\nWithin 8-hours of admission, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with subsequent intubation and fluid resuscitation. She was transferred to the intensive care unit. Because of bright red blood on nasogastric decompression, she was started on IV octreotide given her history of chronic alcoholism and possible variceal bleed. Because of hypotension and SIRS with peritoneal ascites, blood cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin). A diagnostic paracentesis was performed obtaining 1.2 liters of thick serosanguinous peritoneal fluid. Ascitic fluid analysis was suggestive of monomicrobial primary peritonitis, showing abundant Gram-positive cocci and 51,500 leucocytes/mm3 with 67% neutrophils. Ascitic fluid was exudative in nature with total protein 3.8 g/dl, albumin 1.6 g/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 5189/UL and glucose 56 mg/dl. Serum-albumin ascitic-albumin gradient was 0.9 g/dl.\nNo surgical intervention was considered as the possibility of secondary peritonitis was less likely based on her CT and ascitic fluid findings. Blood cultures and ascitic fluid cultures were positive for GAS, and therefore, the patient was started on IV ampicillin and clindamycin for primary GAS peritonitis.\nBecause of hematemesis, the patient underwent EGD that showed diffuse gastric ulcerations, but no esophageal varices or active bleeding. Given diffuse ulceration of stomach with circumferential wall thickening, gastritis was thought to be caused by an underlying ischemic or infiltrative process.\nAlthough the patient\u2019s hemoglobin was stable, and she had required no blood transfusions, her hemodynamic status started to deteriorate requiring multiple pressor support and IV high-dose hydrocortisone. Given the context of isolation of GAS from blood and ascitic fluid, septic shock and multiorgan failure (renal failure and liver failure), a diagnosis of STSS was made. Her lactic acid level worsened from 2.8 at baseline to 42 mM/L. The patient was deemed a non-surgical candidate by the surgical team. However, an ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal drain was placed for therapeutic reasons. The patient received few doses of antibiotics; however, she continued to deteriorate and succumbed to death within 48-hours of admission due to cardiopulmonary arrest and multiorgan failure.\n\nWhat is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", "output": "### Response:\n1.458", "task": "calc"}

The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.\nClinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.\nAt followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle. Antibodies against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined three times by means of an ELISA test. IgG antibodies against VZV were positive at all three determinations and IgM antibodies against VZV were negative at the first and positive at the second and third determination, which is why valacyclovir orally was given for seven days after discontinuation of acyclovir. Antibodies against other viruses and Borrelia burgdorferi were normal. Follow-up 6 weeks after onset showed further recovery of the palsy, such that it was no longer visible in the absence of emotional reactions. Nerve conduction studies confirmed the improvement such that the CMAP amplitude difference was only reduced to 30%.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n75.02", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 50-year-old man of Indian ancestry who was diagnosed with multiple myeloma three years earlier was evaluated in our hospital. His only other chronic medical issue was mild hypertension. His myeloma had progressed rapidly since diagnosis despite a variety of therapies over the years including systemic corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cisplatin, stem cell transplantation, thalidomide, and for the most recent three months, bortezomib. Blood work and magnetic resonance imaging at a recent out-patient visit demonstrated pancytopenia as well as diffuse myelomatous bone marrow replacement throughout his pelvis and proximal femora (Figure ). At this time, he was being hospitalized due to extensive fluid retention in the abdomen and lower extremities as well as dyspnea. He stated that he had gained 15 pounds over the past two weeks. On initial examination, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 100 beats/minute and a blood pressure of 97/50 mmHg. His oxygen saturation was 96% while receiving oxygen at 3 liters/minute by nasal cannula. He had crackles at the bases of his lungs bilaterally. His cardiovascular exam was remarkable for 12 cm of jugular venous distension and tachycardia with a 2/6 systolic flow murmur at the left upper sternal border. His abdomen was distended with shifting dullness to percussion and a liver edge 4 cm below the right costal margin. His extremities were warm to touch with 3 + bilateral lower extremity edema as well as significant scrotal edema. Pertinent initial laboratory studies were remarkable for a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dl, a platelet count of 10,000 per microliter, a blood urea nitrogen of 55 mg/dl, a creatinine of 1.0 mg/dl, an albumin of 3.6 g/dl, and a calcium of 13 mg/dl. The ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with normal voltage and diffuse T wave flattening. His chest X-ray demonstrated mild cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram conveyed a hyperdynamic left ventricle with normal wall thickness, no regional wall motion abnormalities, no valvular abnormalities and normal diastolic function. Thrice daily intravenous furosemide was administered for the first ten hospital days. Despite aggressive diuretic therapy, the patient's volume status worsened. On the eleventh hospital day, cardiac catheterization was performed (Table ). Based on the high output values obtained at catheterization, a thyroid panel was obtained which was unremarkable. In addition, he was given empiric thiamine replacement, placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible sepsis, and was started on a continuous intravenous infusion of furosemide. His respiratory status continued to worsen and on hospital day number 14, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure (Figure ). His volume status continued to worsen over the next 2 days despite the aforementioned therapy. As a last resort, it was decided to initiate therapy targeting the underlying myeloma on hospital day 17. Lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone 40 mg daily were administered through the patient's nasogastric tube. Within 24 hours, a brisk diuresis was observed and he was successfully extubated on hospital day 19. Dexamethasone was discontinued per protocol after hospital day 20, though lenalidomide was continued. By hospital day 27, he had a net negative fluid balance of 15 liters and he was discharged out of the intensive care unit. Unfortunately, on hospital day 35 in the setting of his long standing refractory thrombocytopenia, he developed a massive upper gastrointestinal bleed that could not be controlled despite aggressive resuscitory efforts and died within hours.\n\nUsing the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

This was accompanied by tender swellings in the groin bilaterally that resulted in difficulty walking. She was seen by her family practitioner twice during this episode and was prescribed a 1-week course of oral augmentin, followed by another 5-day course of oral moxifloxacin. Despite the antibiotics, her condition continued to worsen. Ten days from fever onset, she developed a rash over her hands and legs, associated with circumoral numbness. However, no swallowing problems or breathing difficulty were reported. Over the next 4 days, the rash spread to her face and ears associated with markedly tender swellings in her armpits.\nShe has no significant medical history and has been working in Singapore as a domestic helper in the same household for the past 8 years. She is single, with no sexual activity nor gynecologic issues. She has not returned to her native country in the past 3 years.\nOn systemic enquiry, there was no loss of weight or night sweats, no joint swellings or arthralgia, no alopecia, and no dry eyes or mouth. There was also no personal or family history of autoimmune disease (Fig. ).\nOn examination, her temperature was 39.2\u00b0C, pulse rate 120 beats per minute, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. The significant findings concerned the skin, which revealed an erythematous papulonodular eruption scattered over the extensor surfaces of both upper and lower limbs. There were multiple indurated plaques on the face over the nasal bridge, the brow, the outer maxillary area and both earlobes and pinna. This was associated with ankle edema, tender, enlarged and matted cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The differential diagnoses considered included tumid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, cutaneous amyloidosis, lymphoproliferative disease, Sweet syndrome, and Hansen disease.\nRoutine investigations revealed leukocytosis of 36.18 \u00d7 109/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 80 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L. HIV testing, antinuclear antibody, C3, C4, and double-stranded DNA levels were normal. Serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 316 IU/L with otherwise normal liver transaminases. Her albumin level was 34 g/L.\nIn view of the persistent high fever and multiple enlarged lymph nodes with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, she underwent a computed tomography scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis, which showed no intra-abdominal or hepatobiliary source of infection, or abscesses, but revealed multiple enlarged and necrotic lymph nodes in the axilla and inguinal regions consistent with the initial examination findings.\nCloser examination revealed bilaterally thickened greater auricular nerves and lateral peroneal nerves, which further raised the suspicion of leprosy. Complete examination of the central nervous system did not reveal any sensorimotor loss (Fig. ).\nSkin biopsy was performed and histological examination showed a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, sparing the epidermis. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, foamy macrophages, and neutrophils. Some of the inflammation involved the nerves and adnexal structures. Large numbers of acid-fast bacilli were identified on Fite and Ziehl-Neelsen stains. These features are consistent with the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum leprosum.\nShe was started on multidrug therapy comprising of rifampicin, dapsone, and doxycycline. Due to the lack of availability of clofazimine, doxycycline was used as an interim third agent before clofazimine was obtained 2 days later. Prednisolone at 1 mg/kg was also started empirically. Of note, there was no evidence of Lucio phenomenon as she did not have skin erosions or ulcers.\nShe has recovered well on follow-up in the outpatient setting.

After that, she did not complain of any other symptoms.\nOn admission, her laboratory studies showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7,800/mm3, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 287,000/mm3. Blood chemistry revealed serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 21 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 19 IU/L, and glucose of 80 mg/dL. She had normal urinalysis, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), electrolytes, and arterial blood gases. Chest x-ray and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. Ultrasonography of the abdomen did not reveal any significant abnormalities except fatty liver. From day 2 of hospitalization, she reported occasional mild headaches relieved by acetaminophen. Otherwise, her hospital stay was uneventful. She was monitored and managed conservatively in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for two days and later in the general medical ward for the next three days. After a psychiatric evaluation, she was diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder with suicidal ideation. She was prescribed aripiprazole and advised for a regular follow-up. She was discharged on the fifth day of admission. Her laboratory studies were last done on day 4, which demonstrated a WBC count of 6,500/mm3, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, platelet count of 263,000/mm3, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 13 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 15 IU/L, and glucose of 95 mg/dL. The electrolyte levels, PT-INR, and urinalysis were within normal parameters.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 24-year-old man with MFS-related cardiovascular complications was admitted to our Internal Medicine Department because of 3 consecutive episodes of acute decompensated HF with reduced ejection fraction (ADHFrEF) from 2014 through 2017. His remaining medical history includes arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperthyroidism, anaphylactic shock due to flecainide, and previous tabagic habit.\nMFS diagnosis was made in 2010 when ascending aorta and aortic valve substitution with mechanical prosthesis were performed due to type A acute aortic dissection in presence of family history\u2014mother, father, and 3 sons with MFS. During intraoperative period, inferior acute coronary syndrome occurred and was treated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\nOn May 2014, mechanical descending aorta and aortic arch prosthesis implantation were performed due to chronic dissecting aneurysm. Peri-aortic hematoma and medullary ischemia complicated surgery and caused lower limb paraplegia, dolorific and thermal hypoesthesia, and rectal incontinence. After 2 months, during his first admission for ADHFrEF, laboratory tests were notable for N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) of 12,000 pg/mL and transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal prosthesis function, dilatation of all cardiac chambers (mainly the left ones) with moderate mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, left ventricular hypertrophy, inferior wall akinesis, septal dyskinesis, and hypokinesis of the remaining walls with severe left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction \u221220%. He was treated with intravenous diuretics and internal cardiac defibrillator (St. Jude Ellipse DR, DDD mode) without cardiac resynchronization therapy (electrocardiogram criteria not met) and discharged on maximal medical therapy (furosemide, carvedilol, ramipril, spironolactone, digoxin, and amlodipine).\nNew episode of ADHFrEF occurred on august 2017. Notable admission laboratoristic values included NT-proBNP of 2719 pg/mL and midregional-proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) of 1.61 nmol/L, whereas transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram showed an LVEF of 35%, normal prosthesis function, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and rupture of the anterior leaflet of the chordae tendineae with severe mitral regurgitation. Patients were treated yet with intravenous diuretics and digoxin and discharged on optimal medical therapy (furosemide, carvedilol, ramipril, spironolactone, digoxin, and amlodipine).\nLastly, he was readmitted to our Internal Medicine Department on November 2017 due to third episode of ADHFrEF and infected mediastinal fluid collection secondary to 1 month before severe valvular insufficiency surgical correction with mitral mechanical prosthesis implantation (31-mm ST Jude) and De Vega tricuspid annuloplasty.\nPhysical examination was notable for blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, pulse 82 bpm, respiratory rate 26 apm, O2 saturation 87% on room air with orthopneic obligatory position, and Marfanoid habitus (weight 147 kg, height 2.2 m). Cardiopulmonary evaluation revealed metallic second heart sound, stony dull percussion with reduced tactile vocal fremitus and crackles at the basis of the lungs, widely diminished vesicular breath sounds, presence of abundant ascites, and leg swelling.\nNotable laboratoristic values included NT-proBNP of 10,132 pg/mL and MR-proADM of 2.36 nmoL/mL.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxemia with respiratory and metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.56, pO2 46 mm Hg, pCO2 24.8 mm Hg, HCO3\u2212 21.9 mmol/L, alveolar-arterial gradient 31 mm Hg). Although electrocardiogram highlighted atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 80 bpm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and inferolateral subepicardial ischemia, transthoracic echocardiogram showed the same features as the previous except for LVEF of 30%, presence of mitral mechanical prosthesis, with paravalvular leak and mean gradient of 9 mm Hg, and mild tricuspid insufficiency (Fig. A and C).\nHilar congestion with cardiomegaly, right upper lobe pulmonary consolidation, and infected mediastinal fluid collection have been shown on chest x-ray and high-resolution computed tomography, respectively.\nPatient was treated with intravenous furosemide 250 mg q.d., canrenone 100 mg q.d., piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g q6h, and teicoplanin 12 mg/kg b.i.d., then 12 mg/kg q.d. On day 9, once reaching hemodynamic stabilization, sacubitril/valsartan midrange dose of 49/51 mg b.i.d. has been added to carvedilol 3.125 mg b.i.d., spironolactone 100 mg q.d., furosemide 250 mg q.d., and digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.\nOn 1-month follow-up sacubitril/valsartan has been increased to 97/103 mg b.i.d. for patient's good clinical condition, allowing persistent and progressive clinical, laboratory (NT-proBNP reduction and MR-proADM increase), echocardiographic-LVEF increase (42% vs 30%), left ventricle end-systolic diameter, left ventricle end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular mass, and left ventricular mass index reduction, and quality of life improvement without new episodes of ADHFrEF until 9-month follow-up (Fig. B and D; Table ).

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 62-year-old man presented to a nearby clinic with a chief complaint of abdominal fullness and abdominal pain. His medical history was not significant. He was on no medication. He was not allergic to any drug or food. Laboratory tests showed increased peripheral white blood cell count (17,900/\u00b5L) and eosinophil count (12,100/\u00b5L), measured by an automated hematology analyzer, Sysmex XN 2000 (Sysmex corporation, Hyogo, Japan). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed massive ascites and no other abnormalities (Fig. a).\nHe was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. His height was 173 cm, his weight was 105 kg, and his body mass index was 35 kg/m2. He had gained 15 kg in the last month. Physical examination showed abdominal distention and no abdominal tenderness. The white blood cell count was 19,400/\u00b5L, eosinophil count was 13,300/\u00b5L, and C-reactive protein was 0.70 mg/dL. The other data were normal: carcinoembryonic antigen 3 ng/mL, carbohydrate 19\u20139 6 U/mL, and serum IgE 112 IU/mL. His allergen-specific IgE tests were unremarkable. The interferon-gamma release assay was negative. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed massive ascites that had low and high signal intensities on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, respectively. Abdominal paracentesis was performed, and the ascitic fluid was stained with Fluoocell WDF (Sysmex corporation, Hyogo, Japan), then analyzed by flow cytometry with the Sysmex XN 2000 []. The total number of nucleated cells in the ascites was 11,420/\u00b5L, and 69% of them were eosinophils. Its cytology also revealed the most nucleated cells had both of bilobed nuclei and cytoplasmic granules, with no evidence of malignancy (Additional file : Figure S1). Ascitic fluid culture was negative. Upper and lower GI endoscopies were performed on the suspicion of EGIDs. There was a Type II-like lesion in the descending colon that showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma on pathological examination of a biopsy specimen (Fig. a). There were no other abnormal findings in the GI tract. The patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy to find the cause of the ascites, and massive brownish cloudy ascites with reddening or thickening of the mesentery and omentum was seen. The tumor was not exposed to the colonic serosa. There were no enlarged lymph nodes, no abnormal adhesions, and no metastases (Fig. c). Pathology of the mesentery and omentum showed infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly eosinophils, with no malignancy (Additional file : Figure S2). Based on these findings, eosinophilic peritonitis associated with colon cancer was suspected.\nAfter administration of systemic steroid therapy (prednisolone (PSL) 60 mg/day, 1 mg/kg/day), his blood eosinophil count and weight decreased immediately. The dose of PSL was then decreased biweekly. One and a half months after steroid administration, abdominal CT confirmed disappearance of ascites (Fig. b). Laparoscopic left hemicolectomy with regional lymph node dissection (D3) was performed. At laparoscopy, the inflammation of the mesentery and omentum was seen to be relieved, and there was no ascites (Fig. b, d). The patient\u2019s postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. According to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification 8th Edition, the pathological diagnosis was tubular adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, pT3 (SS), int, ly1, v1, PN1, EX0, pN0, sM0, pStage IIA. The pathological specimen also showed eosinophilic infiltration to various lesions, especially omentum, mesentery, and the submucosal layer of the descending colon. He was given adjuvant oral chemotherapy (uracil-tegafur with leucovorin) for six months because there was concern that the pathological ly1 and v1 could increase the risk for recurrence of the cancer [].\nAfter the operation, the dose of PSL was again decreased monthly. He finally stopped taking PSL four months after it was started, and he remains asymptomatic without recurrent ascites at the present time (Fig. ).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n68.653", "task": "calc"}

Her history was negative for systemic disease, and she denied taking any medicine or exposure to toxins. She had experienced two syncope attacks during exercise, four months previously.\nBy physical examination, her the heart rate was 95 beats min-1, respiratory rate was 25 min-1, and blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg. Body temperature was 37 \u00b0C. While she was awake, the respiratory sounds were diminished. Laboratory examinations showed leukocytosis (13.5000 mm3) and elevated acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 83 mm/h; C-reactive protein: 8.2 mg/dL). Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse pneumonic consolidation and mild cardiomegaly. Except for a stable ST depression, electrocardiography (ECG) was normal (). Echocardiography showed thickening of the mitral and aortic valves and mild mitral valve insufficiency. The left ventricle was mildly dilated, but systolic function was within normal limits (the ejection fraction was 68%). The troponin-1 level was high (66 mcg/dL, upper limit: 0.04 mcg/dL). Influenza A virus DNA was detected by respiratory viral panel screening. The toxicologic screening was negative. Throat, blood, and urine cultures were negative. Antistreptolysin O titer was within normal limits. Cranial computed tomography and electroencephalography were normal. We did not detect any arrhythmia by 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given for treatment of myocarditis. We started combined wide-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral oseltamire treatments. At the third day, she had no complaint; acute phase reactants and cardiac markers were negative. Normal cardiac size and clear lung fields were detected by chest X-ray. We stopped giving antibiotics after ruling out bacterial infection. However, there was a stable ST depression in the inferior leads by ECG. Coronary angiography by computed tomography displayed a suspected atheroma plague in the left anterior descending (LAD) aorta. Meanwhile, she had experienced another syncope attack. ECG showed an ST depression in the inferior leads, but the cardiac marker was negative. A cardiovascular stress test showed significant ST depression in the inferior leads (). Conventional coronary angiography revealed a significant occlusion of the LAD artery and circumflex artery (). High serum levels of total cholesterol (756 mg/dL) and LD-cholesterol (LDL-C) (556 mg/dL) were noticed. Carotid artery Doppler imaging showed moderate occlusion in both carotid arteries. When the patient\u2019s medical history was re-taken, we found that her grandmother had been diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and underwent a coronary bypass surgery at 50-years-of-age. Her parents and 4-year-old sister\u2019s blood analyses showed hypercholesterolemia, which was suggesting of HeFH. Diagnosis of HoFH was made in our case based on elevated plasma cholesterol levels, premature CAD, and positive family history. Her coagulation and thrombus panel and thyroid function tests were normal, and metabolic screening tests were negative. She had no tendon xanthomas. A coronary bypass surgery was performed between the left internal mammary arteries (LIMA) and LAD. Rosuvastatin, ezetimibe (a calcium-canal blocker drug), and aspirin treatments were started. After 1 year, she was in good condition and had no complaint. Her electrocardiography was normal. On echocardiogram, mitral and aortic regurgitations persisted. The LDL cholesterol level was slightly decreased (350-450 mg/dL), and we have planned lipid apheresis. She was consulted by the Pediatric Gastroenterology and Transplantation committee at our hospital. Meanwhile, the combined and high doses of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin therapy have resulted in a 37% reduction in her serum LDL level.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 82-year-old woman presented to our hospital emergency department because of repeated vomiting that persisted for 2 days without induction. She had a history of cerebral infarction, hypertension, dementia, and surgery for a perforated sigmoid diverticulum. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy had been performed at another hospital a month ago, but no abnormalities were noted. A physical examination revealed consciousness corresponding to the Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 (E4V3M5), blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg, pulse of 119/min, temperature of 36.5\u00b0C, tachypnea (\u226530 times/min), and 85% oxygen saturation (on room air), with diminished breath sounds on the left side. Chest X-ray revealed a large gastric bubble in the left chest cavity, with the mediastinum strongly displaced to the right side (Fig. ). Oxygen at 5 L/min improved the oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 92%, but tachypnea and tachycardia persisted. We speculated that a worsening esophageal hiatal hernia was probably responsible for the deterioration in respiration and circulation. Computed tomography (CT) performed for a definitive diagnosis showed that the entire stomach had escaped into the mediastinum and that it was craniocaudally inverted with axial torsion. In addition, the mediastinum had undergone a remarkable shift to the right owing to the presence of the dilated stomach; other structures, such as the left lung, heart, and inferior vena cava, were also highly displaced. There was no evidence of pneumonia (Fig. ). Her condition deteriorated to agonal respiration with worsening tachycardia (120\u2013150 times/min) when she returned to the emergency room after the CT scan, and assisted ventilation was immediately initiated. Subsequently, she developed pulseless electrical activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately initiated. CT findings suggested that the dilated stomach, along with the esophageal hiatal hernia, was strongly pressing on the heart, thereby disrupting circulation. Therefore, a gastric tube was used to decompress the stomach through which 1,400 mL of gastric fluid was aspirated. A spontaneous heartbeat resumed immediately, with stable circulation. Chest X-ray performed after the gastric tube insertion revealed normal mediastinal structures and the absence of the previously present giant gastric bubble in the mediastinum (Fig. ). Subsequently, the correction of dehydration by infusion stabilized both the blood pressure and tachycardia; however, because she developed aspiration pneumonia, her respiratory status did not improve and she died on the fourth hospital day (Fig. ).\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n80.0", "task": "calc"}

His past medical history was significant for alcohol use disorder, consuming eight to ten or more drinks per day; his last drink was the evening prior to admission. Previous attempts at alcohol cessation were unsuccessful due to strong withdrawal symptoms, but there was no history of seizures or delirium tremens. When he fell, he had hit his head on the wall, and endorsed being down for one hour with no loss of consciousness. He also complained of three days of copious, watery, nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and poor per os (PO) intake. He denied any subjective fevers, chills, night sweats, vomiting, headache, confusion, sick contacts, or recent change in diet. He was a nonsmoker. Initial vital signs were body temperature 99.3 \u00b0F, pulse rate 115 bpm, blood pressure 165/87 mmHg, and respiration rate 18. Physical exam was unremarkable aside from rales heard on auscultation and positive egophany of the right lower lung lobe. There was no accessory muscle use, no general muscle tenderness or ecchymoses noted. Initial lab tests were significant for ethyl alcohol (EtOH) level 87 mg/dL (normal 0-10) with urine drug screen positive only for ethanol, serum sodium 123 mmol/L (136-148), bicarbonate 18 mmol/L (21-32), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 21 mg/dL (8-20), creatinine 1.3 mg/dL (0.5-1.2), and troponin 0.1 ng/dL (0-0.05). The patient's baseline levels were largely unknown due to his infrequent health care use. Urinalysis was positive for blood, but no red blood cells were present - myoglobin is often detected as blood on urine dipstick testing. Initial Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) scores ranged from 9 to 12, and he was treated per hospital protocol with lorazepam. Chest X-ray revealed patchy right lower lobe infiltrates (Figure ).\nThe patient was treated with IV hydration, thiamine, folic acid, vitamin K, and IV ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia. On hospital day two, he developed worsening leukocytosis to 14.82x10^3 cells/\u00b5L (3.6-11) and fever to 103.1 \u00b0F, and antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and azithromycin. The CPK rose to 10,221 U/L (0-250) on the morning of day two, peaked at 85,780 U/L late on day two, and remained elevated in the 65,000 to 76,000 U/L range through hospital day five; there was a concurrent rise in transaminases with a high AST/ALT ratio (AST:ALT 115:53 units/L on admission, trending upwards to peak of 451:213 units/L on hospital day six) (Figure ).\nHe was treated for rhabdomyolysis with aggressive IV hydration. Creatinine peaked at 1.3 mg/dL on hospital day two, and normalized at 0.9 mg/dL by hospital day five. Early on hospital day three, the Legionella urinary antigen returned positive (sputum cultures were also ordered and eventually tested positive, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was not ordered), and the patient was switched to azithromycin monotherapy. On day five he defervesced, and on day six the CPK dropped dramatically to 13,125 U/L, and continued to decline steadily. A similar pattern was seen with the transaminases. White blood cell (WBC) count trended consistently down from admission, maintaining the lowest range counts of 5.42-6.05 x10^3 cells/\u00b5L between hospital days four through six (leukocytosis resolved between hospital days two and three). Blood, urine, and stool cultures and a Clostridium difficile PCR were all negative; the diarrhea resolved, and his hemodynamic and respiratory status remained stable throughout the hospitalization.

She had no abnormalities in her pediatric medical history, but from the age 18, she had slowly begun experiencing headaches in her left temporal lobe, nausea, and vomiting. In June of that year, she experienced generalized convulsions and aphasia. In a brain MRI and MRA, an infarction in the posterior divisions of the left mesencephalic arteries was found. Also, in a blood test, an increase in lactic acid was discovered (7.54 mM/L [normal level: 0.5-2.254 mM/L]). The patient was suspected to have MELAS syndrome. She was diagnosed with MELAS after testing (adenosine-to-guanine transition at t-RNA nucleotide 3243 in PCR sequencing). After she turned 21, she was diagnosed with Type I DM. The patient had to orally ingest 200 mg of carbamazepine and 100 mg of aspirin per day and subcutaneously inject 30 units of insulin in the morning and 20 units in the evening. She had no history of total anesthesia.\nIn a physical examination before the anesthesia, the patient was able to read but had auditory aphasia such that she could not understand spoken words. In the physical examination, there were no signs of hypotonia or amyotrophy of the limbs. The laboratory results showed hyponatremia (126 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (257 mg/dl), and light metabolic acidosis (pH 7.346, PaCO2 36.3 mmHg, HCO3 20.1 mM/L, BE -5.3 mM/L). There were no abnormal findings in the chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. One year prior to her admission to the hospital, she had an ECG that revealed a cardiac index of 67% and no abnormal findings. For sugar control, 4 units of shortacting insulin were injected, and 0.9% normal saline was administered to control hyponatremia. No other pre-operative measures were performed.\nAfter the patient was taken to the operating room, we attached ECG standard leads II, noninvasive monitors for blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, capnogram, and bispectral index (BIS), and a nerve stimulator to the patient using the Multi Channel Anesthesia Monitor S/5\u2122 (Datex-Ohmeda, USA). Preliminary vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 115/65 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats/min, oxygen saturation rate 97%, and the ECG results appeared normal. The patient underwent 3 minutes of denitrogenation with 100% oxygen through a face mask. Afterwards, we administered lidocaine (40 mg) with the Master TCI (Fresenius Vial S.A., France); we then injected 2% propofol (Fresofol\u00ae, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) and remifentanil (Ultiva\u2122, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) at target concentrations of 4 \u00b5g/ml (Marsh-model) and 5 ng/ml (Minto-model), respectively. After roughly 90 seconds had passed, we checked lid reflexes and found that the patient had lost consciousness. We administered atracurium (0.5 mg/kg), the BIS was 50, and we saw that there was no response to TOF stimulation with the nerve stimulator placed on the ulnar nerve. Endotracheal intubation was then performed without complications. We started mechanical respiration with air (1.5 L/min), oxygen (1.5 L/min), respiratory volume of 450 ml, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. To control ventilation, the capnogram was kept at 35-40 mmHg. We used spirometry to measure the respiratory volume and pulmonary compliance. We started invasive blood pressure monitoring through the radial artery and measured the esophageal temperature with a body temperature monitor. During the operation, we used a forced-air warming blanket (Bair Hugger\u2122, Austine Medical, USA) to stabilize the patient's body temperature. For fluid maintenance, we administered 0.9% normal saline at 200 ml per hour. During the operation, the patient's vitals were kept stable with blood pressure at 120-140/60-80 mmHg, heart rate 80-100 beats/min, oxygen saturation 100%, body temperature 37.0-37.4\u2103, and BIS 40-60. Thirty minutes after inducing anesthesia, the arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 32 mmHg, PaO2 299 mmHg, HCO3 23.3 mM/L, BE -2.1 mM/L; her electrolytes were Na+ 125 mEq/L, K+ 3.8 mEq/L, Cl- 88 mEq/L; and her blood sugar was 176 mg/dl. Twenty minutes prior to the end of the operation, we administered ondansetron (4 mg) to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting. After suturing the peritoneum, we stopped injecting remifentanil, kept the level of propofol in the target effect site at 2 \u00b5g/ml, and restored spontaneous breathing. After the operation was over, we stopped injecting propofol and stabilized spontaneous breathing at 300 ml per breath on the spirometer. On the nerve stimulator, the TOF rate was kept at 0.95. To reverse the muscle relaxant effects, we administered glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) and pyridostigmine (15 mg). Afterwards, the patient responded to voice commands and opened her eyes. With stabilized spontaneous breathing, she was extubated. The operation lasted around 1 hour, and during the operation, 350 ml of 0.9% normal saline were used. We then moved the patient to the recovery room and kept her under observation with blood pressure, electrogram, and oxygen saturation monitors. In the recovery room, we gave her oxygen at 5 L/min through the facial mask. The arterial blood gas study showed pH 7.32, PaCO2 43 mmHg, PaO2 219 mmHg, HCO3 21.2 mM/L, and BE -3.6 mM/L; her electrolyte levels were Na+ 128 mEq/L, K+ 4.1 mEq/L, and Cl- 90 mEq/L; and her blood sugar level was 120 mg/dl. We then moved the patient to the ward where we performed a lactic acid test, which measured 3.6 mM/L. Three days after the operation, the patient showed no complications from the operation or anesthesia, so she was released from the hospital.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta ratio?", "output": "### Response:\n1.714", "task": "calc"}

She reported a history of dry cough for 2 years with progressive dyspnoea, hoarseness of voice and wheezing for last 3 months. Patient had received treatment with bronchodilators and steroids and was being managed on the lines of bronchial asthma with no relief. Auscultation of chest revealed bilateral wheeze. Chest X-ray was normal, computerized tomography of chest and lower neck revealed a soft-tissue mass close to thoracic inlet, attached to left posterior wall in upper trachea causing luminal compromise. Positron emission tomography scan revealed 1.2 cm \u00d7 1.1 cm size soft-tissue mass at the level of C7 to D1 projecting into the tracheal lumen. On room air SpO2 was 95.3% while the arterial blood gas analysis showed PaO2 of 86 mmHg, PaCO2 40 mmHg, pH 7.42.\nPre-operative fiberoptic bronchoscopy was not done so as to avoid any airway irritation, which might have led to critical or complete airway obstruction.\nIn the operation theatre, patient was placed in supine position and standard monitoring including pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and non-invasive blood pressure was connected. An intravenous access was obtained followed by commencement of intravenous fluid. Injection fentanyl in slow incremental doses up to 100 \u03bcg and injection midazolam 1.5 mg intravenous bolus was given. This was followed by propofol infusion starting at 10 mg/kg/h until patient slept and gradually titrating it to 6 mg/kg/h followed by 1.5 mg/kg/h, at which level it was maintained throughout the procedure. After obtaining an adequate depth of anaesthesia an appropriate size nasopharyngeal airway was inserted, which was connected to anaesthesia circuit for delivery of air-oxygen mixture while maintaining spontaneous ventilation. Local anaesthetic spraying of airway with 4% lignocaine spray was done before insertion of rigid bronchoscope to prevent any stimulation of airway. This was followed by connection of anaesthesia circuit to the side arm of rigid bronchoscope and 2-4% sevoflurane with air O2 mixture was given to supplement intravenous propofol infusion for prevention of any stimulation of airway, which could precipitate complete obstruction.\nA tracheostomy tray was prepared and kept ready in the event of failure to control airway. Tumour tissue [] was extracted with rigid bronchoscopy forceps; bleeding was controlled by using adrenaline soaked gauze pieces and cautery.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 39-year-old female presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath. She had a significant history of intravenous (IV) drug abuse and stated she had last used heroin one day prior. She had also been hospitalized at an outside facility a month prior for sepsis secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and tricuspid valve endocarditis. At that time she was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged on linezolid, but she did not complete the full treatment course. The patient had also been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism during that hospitalization and was discharged on apixaban. She had taken her last dose of apixaban the day before presenting to the ER for this admission. Review of systems was significant for pleuritic chest pain, a cough with no sputum production that also exacerbated chest pain, nausea and vomiting for the past week.\nInitial vitals were as follows: temperature 102\u00b0F, pulse rate 145 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical exam revealed track marks that were present on the left neck. Chest auscultation revealed that the patient was tachycardic with an early systolic murmur at the left sternal border and shallow but clear breath sounds bilaterally. Old scarring from an abscess on the right thigh and track marks were present behind the right knee.\nInitial workup revealed an elevated lactic acid of 3.1 mmol/L, leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 22.4 k/cmm, elevated D-dimer, an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 2,229 pg/ml, a mildly elevated troponin of 0.093 ng/ml that trended to 0.085 ng/ml and finally 0.054 ng/ml. Cultures were drawn, and the patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. A transthoracic echo revealed a 1.3-cm vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve confirmed with a transesophageal echocardiogram. The CT revealed multiple occlusive emboli in her pulmonary artery involving the right lobar segment and segmental branches of lower limbs bilaterally, along with extensive airspace disease with cavitations that were possibly septic. Blood cultures grew Serratia, and the patient\u2019s antibiotics were optimized to piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin, and linezolid due to concerns over possible non-clearance of previous MRSA infection.\nThe patient was initially started on a heparin drip while cardiothoracic surgery planned to operate on her to remove the vegetation. The patient\u2019s white count steadily trended down and vitals became more stable. Unfortunately, the heparin Xa unfractionated level was low (initially 0.16 IU/ml), indicating subtherapeutic anticoagulation. On day 1, the patient received a total of 6,021 IU of heparin at an average infusion rate of 18 IU/kg/hr. On day 2, the patient received a total of 47,632.8 IU of heparin at an average infusion rate of 23 IU/kg/hr. On day 3, the patient received a total of 60,143.1 IU of heparin at an average dose rate of 31 IU/kg/hr. On day 4, the patient received 66,900 IU of heparin at an average dose rate of 35 IU/kg/hr. And on day 5, the patient received 71,716.8 IU at an average dose rate of 38 IU/kg/hr. The patient received 40 IU/kg bolus of heparin per hospital standards with every infusion change (approximately every six hours). Despite the increasing titration of heparin, the highest anti-Xa level was no more than 0.27 IU/ml. On the sixth day of admission, the patient started complaining of increasing right-sided chest pain and CT chest showed a worsening area of probable infarct in the right lung. With concern for increasing lung infarction in the setting of subtherapeutic anticoagulation, heparin was stopped and subsequently the patient was started on argatroban. The following morning (day 7), the fibrinogen level dropped significantly to 50 from 650 mg/dl. There was a significant concern for DIC, but clinically the patient showed no signs of active bleeding or clinical worsening.\nIn the setting of sepsis from an uncontrolled source (infective endocarditis), a sudden drop in fibrinogen levels alerted all providers to a possible coagulopathic state of DIC. Of note, the patient had no clinical signs of DIC and the platelet levels were regularly above the 400,000 k/cmm. In the interest of precaution, the patient had argatroban therapy held. Six hours later, the DIC panel showed a fibrinogen of 470 mg/dl and platelets remained above 400,000 k/cmm. Low molecular weight heparin was started. Four-hour post-administration Xa level was not therapeutic at 0.23 IU/ml. For that reason, low molecular weight heparin was stopped, and the patient was started on bivalirudin.

Her initial lab results were significant for a potassium of 2.0 mMol/L, bicarbonate of 17 mMol/L, AG of 16 mMol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 85 mg/dL, and creatinine of 3.9 mg/dL. The rest of the labs are outlined in Table . Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm (Figure ). The patient was given 120 mEq of KCL, started on IVF, and admitted for the management of hypokalemia, renal impairment, and abdominal pain workup. On further questioning, she reported taking ibuprofen 800 mg on an average of 10-12 tablets/day for the past 10 months to help with the pain from chronic venous stasis ulcers. She denied taking any other medications, having diarrhea, and episodes of hypokalemia in the past.\nPotassium on day two of admission remained low at 2.3 mMol/L and even after 180 mEq of KCL was repleted, it continued to be low at 2.7 mMol/L on day four. Meanwhile, the urine potassium/creatinine ratio was obtained on day four, and it was 20.6 mEq/gm, indicating urine loss of potassium. The patient remained normotensive, and the serum aldosterone was 2 ng/dL, ruling out hyperaldosteronism. The urine anion gap was found to be positive 12.7 and urine pH was 6 pointing toward the distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).\nAfter ruling out the other possible etiologies, a diagnosis of ibuprofen-induced hypokalemia and distal RTA was reached.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 93-year-old female presented to the ED with complaints of two episodes of black, tarry stool over the previous 24 hours that turned lime-green in color when it contacted the water in the toilet bowl. She expressed personal concern for GI hemorrhage, as she had a similar episode of melena one year prior and was subsequently found to have a gastric ulcer thought to be secondary to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The ulcer was treated with endoscopic ablation and the patient had been symptom free since that time. Further past medical history included hypertension and stage III chronic kidney disease. Her only home medications included a daily multivitamin and an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement.\nA detailed history obtained in the ED revealed that she had eaten a fast-food hamburger and frozen beverage the evening prior to the onset of her perceived melanotic stool. Further questioning revealed that the hamburger bun and beverage were both dyed black in color as a promotional event by the fast-food restaurant in celebration of Halloween. She denied ongoing NSAID use that had seemingly contributed to her previously mild upper GI bleed (UGIB).\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 132/79 millimeters of mercury, a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. She denied abdominal discomfort. Serology testing showed a chronic and otherwise stable hemoglobin of 11.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (reference range 11.5\u201315.5 g/dL), a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (8\u201328 mg/dL), a creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (0.5\u20131.5 mg/dL), and a BUN to creatinine ratio of 9.4.\nDigital rectal exam done in the ED revealed a bright, lime-green stool without obvious evidence of melena or hematochezia. A guaiac FOBT (gFOBT) was performed. Despite the grossly bright, lime-green appearance of the specimen, this turned dark green to black in color with a blue hue when developer was introduced. Appearance of occult blood in stool specimens is considered when a blue coloration is appreciated on the indicator card. However, given the duration of the patient\u2019s symptoms, the absence of acute anemia, the lack of observed melena on digital rectal exam, and the history of recent ingestion of artificially dyed food, a false positive gFOBT was considered.\nA shared decision-making discussion on inpatient observation vs close outpatient follow-up was done with the gastroenterologist, the emergency physician, and the patient. Given the absence of melena on digital rectal exam, a stable hemoglobin level near her baseline, and patient preference, she was felt to be reasonable for close outpatient follow-up. Further, she had a calculated Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score of 1, which would suggest a predicted survivability without intervention at a sensitivity of 98.6%. Following a four-hour observation period, she remained asymptomatic and without observed melena. The patient was discharged home with close outpatient follow-up the next day.\nA repeat hemoglobin level obtained 12 hours after ED discharge was unchanged at 11.2 g/dL. A one-year follow-up of the patient\u2019s medical record from her primary physician showed no return visits to the ED, and no diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopy had been performed.

He graduated from junior high school but did not go to high school or work. He presented to our hospital after visiting a general practitioner for epigastric discomfort and nausea. At that time, urinalysis revealed massive proteinuria. On the next day, he was referred and admitted to our hospital for a thorough examination. He had no history of hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, drug abuse, ureteral reflux, premature birth, or any other diseases.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.7\u00b0C, a body weight of 62 kg, and a height of 168 cm. Blood pressure was 157/85 mm Hg. There were evident leg edema, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, and no skin lesions. The laboratory findings revealed decreased serum total protein (5.9 g/dL) and albumin (2.6 g/dL); normal serum creatinine (SCr, 0.9 mg/dL) and eGFR (95 mL/min/1.73 m2); elevated LDL cholesterol (224 mg/dL); and slightly elevated serum calcium (10.6 mg/dL). BNP level was remarkably elevated (1,850 pg/mL). Urinalysis revealed a subnephrotic level of urinary protein (3.0 g/day), microhematuria (5\u20139/HPF), no leukocyturia, and no bacteria. The soluble interleukin 2 receptor level was elevated (2,905 U/mL); serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal (14.2 U/L); renin activity was remarkably elevated (39 ng/mL/h); plasma aldosterone level was within normal limits (184 pg/mL). The urinary N-acetyl-glucosaminidase level was remarkably elevated (85.6 IU/L). Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen and antibody were all negative. Immunoglobulins, complements, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all negative. Tuberculin test was negative.\nThe chest X-ray showed enhanced pulmonary congestion and no detectable hilar lymphadenopathy. In contrast, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed hilar lymphadenopathy without fibrosis in any lung field. Furthermore, abdominal CT revealed bilateral normal-sized kidneys and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed uptakes in the pulmonary hilum, mediastinum, bilateral submaxillary glands, bilateral parotid glands, and bilateral inguinal regions. Echocardiography detected severe cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction 25%), diffuse akinesis of the ventricular wall, and atrial septal defect, but it did not detect thinning of the interventricular septum base. However, electrocardiogram-gated cardiac CT revealed thinning of the interventricular septum base, and this finding was supported by a cine magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac dysfunction and thinning of the ventricular septum base were supportive findings of cardiac sarcoidosis.\nOn the first admission, the patient received treatment for heart failure and hypertension, including temocapril hydrochloride, calcium channel antagonist, carvedilol, spironolactone, and carperitide. Thereafter, the urinary protein level decreased to <1 g/day, and the heart failure and hypertension improved. On the 30th hospital day, the patient was discharged. The inguinal biopsy that was performed as outpatient procedure detected granulomas; therefore, the diagnosis was sarcoidosis. On the 69th day, the SCr level gradually increased to 2.00 mg/dL (eGFR 39.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio increased to 3.2 g/gCr. At this time, the serum albumin and LDL cholesterol levels were 3.7 g/dL and 134 mg/dL, respectively. Therefore, he was readmitted for renal investigation.\nSubsequent renal biopsy revealed the presence of 32 glomeruli, 8 of which showed global sclerosis. Mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, or epithelial change was not observed. In 4 glomeruli, segmental sclerotic lesions were found near the vascular pole and were classified as the perihilar variant of FSGS [] (Fig. ). The diameter of the Bowman's space of the FSGS lesions was maintained at approximately 200\u2013230 \u03bcm. Conversely, several ischemic glomerular changes were found, including atrophic Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft shrinking, and global sclerosis (Fig. ). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration accounted for 70% of the renal parenchyma. Mononuclear cell infiltration, giant cells, and noncaseous granulomas in the tubulointerstitium were noted. The majority of the granulomas involved small arteries and/or arterioles, many of which had intimal wall thickness, reduplicated internal elastic lamina, and narrow lumen (Fig. ). Many of the epithelioid cells of these granulomas were arranged concentrically around the artery/arteriole and formed a multilayer structure.\nImmunostaining by an enzyme-labeled antibody method revealed focal and segmental deposits of IgM (1+) in the glomerular lesions. In the tubulointerstitium, no significant deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, and C3 were found. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68-positive macrophage accumulation in the tubulointerstitial granulomas but not in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy did not detect any glomeruli. Based on these findings, the pathological diagnosis was tubulointerstitial granulomatous angiocentric vasculitis with FSGS.\nHe received oral prednisolone 30 mg/day after the renal biopsy revealed renal sarcoidosis. At 27 days after the initiation of steroid therapy, the SCr level decreased to 1.60 mg/dL (eGFR 50.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), with a simultaneous decrease in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio to <0.5 g/gCr. Thereafter, oral prednisolone was tapered to 25 mg/day, and the patient was discharged on the 38th day of the second hospital stay (the 108th day).\nAfter discharge, his blood pressure stabilized. Later in the clinical course, nifedipine could be reduced, and temocapril was discontinued. Echocardiography showed recovery of cardiac function (ejection fraction 55.4%). Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered to 2 mg/day after 8 years of steroid initiation, and the SCr level decreased to 1.22 mg/dL (eGFR 60.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) after 8.8 years of the initial presentation. The urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was maintained at <0.3 g/gCr. No other immunosuppressants were used. No relapse in the clinical course has occurred at the time of writing this manuscript.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

During the immediate post transplant period, he received three intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone 1 g each daily for acute cellular rejection. He did not develop major infections till the current episode. His weight was 58 kg. He had stable graft function, with serum creatinine at 1.6 mg/dl and was on prednisolone 10 mg/d, azathioprine 100 mg/d and cyclosporine 175 mg/d, with the trough (C0) and 2-hour (C2) cyclosporine levels being 368 and 1280 ng/ml, respectively, at 6 months after transplantation.\nThree years after transplantation, he presented to us with 4 months history of fever, weight loss of 16 kg in 4 months, episodic small volume diarrhea and diffuse abdominal pain with occasional hematochezia. He did not have pulmonary or other gastrointestinal symptoms. He discontinued cyclosporine 4 months prior to visiting our center. At presentation, he was on prednisolone (10 mg/d) and azathioprine (100 mg/d). On examination, his weight was 38 kg, and pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate were normal. He was pale but did not have icterus or peripheral lymphadenopathy or allograft tenderness. He had a diffuse, ill-defined, firm, tender mass (9 \u00d7 7 cm) in the right hypochondrium. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.\nLaboratory investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dl), a total leukocyte count of 4200/mm3, a normal platelet count and serum albumin of 2.2 g/dl. He had renal allograft dysfunction (serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dl) with normal electrolyte profile and liver enzymes. His chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined minimal haziness in the right upper and midzones with minimal pleural effusion. Ultrasonogram of abdomen showed an intussusception mass measuring 7.1 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 10.1 cm in the right hypochondrium with a few enlarged mesenteric nodes and fat within and adjacent to it []. The renal allograft appeared normal. Computed tomogram (CT) scan of abdomen with rectal contrast revealed an ileocolic intussusception up to the hepatic flexure with multiple enlarged mesenteric nodes and mesenteric fat pulled into it []. The ascending colon was thick. The para-aortic, mesenteric and para-iliac nodes were enlarged and showed central necrosis.\nThe patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with resection of the ileocolic intussusception, the adjacent ascending colon and terminal ileum []. Histopathological examination of the ileocolic intussusception revealed fragments of a lymph node with extensive caseation necrosis and many acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The proximal polypoidal lesion of the intussusceptum and the mucosal ulcerations of the intussuscepient colonic segment revealed dense inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with microabscesses in the submucosa and lamina propria, transmural granulomas with epitheloid histiocytes, lymphocytes; Langhans type multinucleated giant cells and central foci of caseation [Figure and ]. Long, curved and beaded AFB, morphologically typical of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), were detected in all the above-mentioned lesions [].\nOn the first postoperative day, the patient received hydrocortisone 100 mg thrice daily, but azathioprine was discontinued due to leukopenia (WBC count 1900/mm3). He received granulocyte colony stimulating factor for leukopenia. On the second postoperative day, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation. On the fourth postoperative day, he received ATT with isoniazid 300 mg/d, rifampicin 450 mg/d, pyrazinamide 750 mg/d and ethambutol 400 mg/d. On the fifth postoperative day, 36 hours after starting ATT, he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, oliguria and worsening of pulmonary oxygenation [partial pressure to inspired fraction of oxygen ratio (P\u2013F ratio)]. The chest radiograph revealed worsening of the preexisting haziness. However, there was no bacteremia or evidence of invasive fungal infection.The total leukocyte count had remained about 4500 cells/mm3 during this period. His condition subsequently worsened, and he received broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin with tazobactam) while routine cultures remained sterile. A tracheal aspirate showed numerous AFB morphologically typical of MTB, though there was no growth in culture. In addition, tracheal aspirate grew mixture of non-fermenting gram negative bacilli and Candida glabrata, which were probably contaminants. He continued to develop worsening features of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, lung infiltrates, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Steroids were continued, antibiotics were changed empirically to meropenem with teicoplanin and liposomal amphotericin B. The patient died on the 11th postoperative day.

There were no past history or family history before the surgery. The patient was 66.6 kg and 164 cm tall, and all physical and general examination results were normal other than the ventricular bradycardia of 58 beats per minute in the ECG. Glycopyrrate (0.2 mg) was IM injected as a pre-anesthetic medication, while vital signs before anesthesia were normal other than the ventricular bradycardia of 45 beats per minute.\nIntravenous anesthesia was planned, rather than anesthesia using a volatile agent, in order to perform nerve integrity monitoring during surgery. Before inducing anesthesia, the BIS sensor was attached while the patient was conscious, and the BIS values registered 95. Medication was started with Fresofol\u00ae MCT 2% (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, German), with a target site concentration of 6 \u00b5g/ml and Remifentanil target site concentration of 4 ng/ml using Orchestra base primea (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, German). After confirming loss of consciousness, rocuronium (50 mg) was IV injected and manual ventilation was maintained with oxygen at 6 L/min. After confirming that there was sufficient muscle relaxation and with BIS values decreased to 44, oral intubation was performed with an endotracheal tube, with a diameter of 7.5 mm (Safety-Flex\u2122, Mallinckrodt), using a curved laryngoscope. Ventilation was maintained with O2 of 1.5 L/min and air of 2 L/min, and with a target site concentration of 3.5 \u00b5g/ml and Remifentanil target site concentration of 3.0 ng/ml being continuously IV injected, the BIS values were maintained between 41 to 60.\nSubsequently, the NIM-2 was attached, and when electricity was applied to measure the resistance in the facial nerve monitoring mode, a severe artifact in the EEG was observed intermittently for 15 seconds on the BIS monitor. A message then appeared on the BIS monitor indicating that the data unavailable due to poor signal quality, so further BIS monitoring was impossible (). Hence, when NIM-2 monitoring was discontinued, the EEG was monitored normally again and it was observed that the BIS monitor was able to read the values.\nIt was impossible to monitor NIM-2 and BIS simultaneously, but the BIS values had been stable during continuous IV injection of the medication before starting NIM-2 monitoring, while the surgery itself was a stable surgery, so it was decided not to observe BIS values during NIM-2 monitoring, and instead, a continuous IV injection speed with target site concentration of Fresofol at 3.5 \u00b5g/ml and Remifentanil at 3.0 ng/ml was maintained. The surgery continued without BIS monitoring, but when NIM-2 monitoring was suspended, before the suturing of the operated area at the completion of tympanoplasty, EEG waves were detected on the BIS monitor again. After completing the suture and dressing of the operated area, all administered anesthetics were suspended. When spontaneous respiration was observed, following the increase in BIS values, pyridostigmine (10 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) were administered in order to reverse muscle relaxation. When spontaneous respiration was sufficiently recovered, BIS monitor showed a value of 91 and the patient was able to open his eyes and obey oral commands. At this point, extubation was performed and the patient was moved to the recovery room. The total surgery time was 3 hours, with the anesthesia time at 3 hours and 45 minutes.\nThe patient was moved to the ward from the recovery room with no special problems, and was discharged after undergoing a recovery period of 5 days in the hospital ward.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 9-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with a history of headache and vomiting for 2 days, accompanied by a single episode of transient weakness in his legs, and altered consciousness for half a day. Ten days before admission, he hit his head against an ice surface in a fall. He experienced no neurological symptoms after hitting his head and did not go to the hospital. Upon arrival, he was conscious, his muscle strength was symmetrical, and deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetrical. His neck was stiff, but he had no other neurological deficits. His weight was 52 kg; height: 145 cm; body mass index: 24.7 kg/m2 (>P97). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of vascular plaque in the patient\u2019s head and neck revealed right internal jugular vein, transverse sinus, and sigmoid sinus thrombosis (). MRI of the head showed right temporal-parietal lobe hemorrhage (). The results of a comprehensive thrombophilia workup constituting protein C activity, protein S activity, antithrombin III, antiphospholipid syndrome antibody, and homocysteine concentration were normal. A thrombophilia workup was performed routinely to evaluate acute thrombosis of unknown cause. The D-dimer level was 90.65 nmol/L (range: 0\u201316.13 nmol/L), and routine blood laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin: 120 g/L, platelets: 182 \u00d7 109/L, and leukocytes: 13.2 \u00d7 109/L with neutrophilia. Tumor marker concentrations were within normal ranges and constituted free prostate-specific antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, prostate-specific antigen, non-small cell lung cancer-associated antigen, neuron-specific enolase, carbohydrate antigen 199, carbohydrate antigen 72-4, and carcinoembryonic antigen. He was treated with glycerol fructose. Thrombectomy was not performed owing to his stable condition and mild symptoms, and because of the intracranial hemorrhage, anticoagulant therapy was not started. His neurological symptoms resolved, and he was discharged. One month after discharge, repeat brain MRI showed that the thrombus had not disappeared, although the signal intensity was lower than in the first scan. MRI also showed that the intracranial hemorrhage was smaller; therefore, we did not initiate anticoagulation.\nHe returned to our hospital with an intermittent fever, 3.5 months after discharge. In the outpatient department, the attending doctor considered infection and performed routine blood evaluation, which showed hemocytopenia. Therefore, leukemia was suspected, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Bone marrow aspiration and immunophenotyping revealed ALL with intermediate risk owing to central nervous system leukemia. Brain magnetic resonance venography (MRV) revealed right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus thrombosis (), which was noted previously. The child had no neurological symptoms; therefore, we did not initiate anticoagulation. He was started on induction therapy comprising vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase, and corticosteroids. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was within normal limits, and flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 27.32% abnormal immature B cells and only 5 white blood cells. After chemotherapy, bone marrow analysis demonstrated that the leukemia was in remission. The patient presented with severe vomiting 22 days after chemotherapy. The fibrinogen concentration had decreased to 0.72 g/L (range: 1.8\u20134.0 g/L), and cerebral MRV showed right sigmoid sinus, transverse sinus, and sagittal sinus thrombosis (). Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed hemorrhage alongside the cerebral falx (). L-asparaginase was stopped, and owing to the intracranial hemorrhage, we did not start anticoagulation. Four days after developing the new CVST, the patient presented with persistent seizures and left-sided weakness. CT of the head showed right frontal lobar hemorrhage (). Because he was receiving anti-epileptic drugs, mannitol, and glycerin fructose, he showed remarkable improvement in the left-sided hemiplegia with only residual grade II weakness in his upper left extremity and focal seizures. However, the parenchymal hemorrhage worsened (). He continued to receive dehydrating therapy and antiepileptic drugs, and eventually, his neurological symptoms resolved completely. Brain CT showed that the hemorrhage had been absorbed, and he received L-asparaginase again 50 days after L-asparaginase cessation.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

He was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and discharged home. Two days later, he returned to the emergency room with a worsening cough, productive of white sputum, shortness of breath, and fever. On review of systems, he was also noted to have decreased oral intake and several episodes of emesis. There were no known sick contacts. On exam, he was febrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic. He was noted to be pale and mildly dehydrated. Decreased breath sounds were appreciated over the right lung field. Initial labs were as follows: hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit 28.7%, platelet count 474,000 g/dL, sodium 134 meq/L, potassium 3.8 meq/L, chloride 98 meq/L, HCO3 15 meq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, glucose 67 mg/dL, calcium 9.3 mg/dL. His urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.016, trace ketones, 30 mg/dL protein, trace blood, and urine microscopy showed 4 WBCs and 2 RBCs. Initial chest X-ray showed a right sided middle and lower lobe pneumonia and a small right sided pleural effusion. In the emergency room, the patient was given a dose of ceftriaxone, started on oxygen for increased work of breathing, given an IV fluid bolus of normal saline and admitted to the general pediatric floor.\nHis past medical history was significant for iron deficiency anemia diagnosed at 11 months of age; he had a normal hemoglobin electrophoresis at that time. Family history and social history was non-contributory. The patient has no known drug allergies. He was noted to have normal growth and development.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient was noted to have increasing respiratory distress. Repeat chest X-ray and a chest sonogram showed a large right sided pleural effusion with multiple thick septations. He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for management of empyema. Concurrently, his BUN and creatinine increased to 67 mg/dL and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively, and his hemoglobin and platelet counts both decreased to 3.2 g/dL and 23 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was 5,850 U/L, total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was prolonged to 60.7 seconds. The patient was transferred to the PICU for further care.\nPediatric hematology, nephrology, and transfusion medicine were consulted. The peripheral smear was notable for toxic granulation in the neutrophils, large platelets, burr cells, target cells, microspherocytes, and schistocytes. Antibody screen was negative but the direct antiglobulin test was positive with both IgG and polyspecific antisera. Anti-I was identified at 4 \u00b0C. The patient\u2019s RBCs mixed with 5 randomly selected, AB0-identical, antibody screen negative, normal adult serum samples showed strong agglutination (4+). This is consistent with T-antigen activation. Lectin agglutination was not done. Analysis for other etiologies of atypical HUS, including testing for Factor H and CH50, were not sent as these studies are not readily available at our institution. ADAMST13 testing was not performed as there was a low clinical suspicion for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\nDue to urgent transfusion need, washed RBCs were not initially available and the patient was given a RBC transfusion with a resultant increase in the hemoglobin from 3.2 g/dL to 5.5 g/dL. Forced-air warming was initiated in an attempt to keep the patient warm.\nOn hospital day 4, he became oliguric. This coincided with a peak in his BUN and creatinine to 103 mg/dL and 2.8 mg/dL, respectively. A temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed and continuous veno venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated. A right sided chest tube was placed. Blood cultures and pleural fluid cultures taken at two separate times during the hospitalization were negative, but the urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen was positive. His hemoglobin again dropped to 3.7 g/dL. At this time, he was transfused with washed RBCs. The hemoglobin was noted to increase to 8.4 g/dL and the platelet count to 22 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L. Despite this increase, the patient had persistent hemolysis, and the hemoglobin again decreased to a low of 5.6 g/dL by hospital day 5. He was given an additional washed RBC transfusion with an increase in hemoglobin to 10.1 g/dL and an increase in platelet count from 18 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L to 32 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L.\nOn hospital day 6, it was decided to initiate plasmapheresis secondary to pHUS disease progression. The patient weighed 14 kg and was 101 cm tall. The total blood volume was calculated as 1,442 mL. Because of the patient\u2019s size, washed RBCs were used to prime the COBE\u00ae Spectra for the PE procedure. The apheresis machine was primed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with normal saline and anticoagulant citrate dextrose A (ACD-A) and subsequently primed a second time with 0.5 U of RBCs. 5% albumin (~ 1 L per procedure) was used as replacement fluid. The ACD-A to whole blood ratio was 1 : 15. The access was a right internal jugular Shiley catheter. After the first PE, the hemoglobin increased to a high of 12.1 g/dL and then gradually decreased to 7.6 g/dL by hospital day 9. The platelet count gradually increased from 32 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L immediately following PE, to 68 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L by hospital day 9. At this time, it was decided to perform a second PE using the same prime and replacement fluid. The following day, the hemoglobin rose to 9 g/dL, and by hospital day 11, the platelet count increased to 166 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L.\nThe hemoglobin gradually decreased following the second PE to 5 g/dL on hospital day 16. The patient was transfused with washed RBCs, after which the hemoglobin remained greater than 9 g/dL until discharge on hospital day 24. The platelet count remained stable from hospital day 11 until discharge. On the day of discharge, the hemoglobin and platelet count were 10 g/dL and 429 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively. The two values remained normal on follow-up ().\nWith respect to his renal course, the patient was transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis on hospital day 6. He received a total of five hemodialysis treatments, his last treatment on hospital day 12. His creatinine on hospital day 12 was 3.3 mg/dL and declined to 0.4 mg/dL on hospital day 24. He went home on amlodipine for hypertension.\nThe chest tube was removed on hospital day 11. On hospital day 15, the patient had significant desaturations with a new oxygen requirement. A chest CT revealed a large air cavity representing a pneumatocele of the right lung base. His antibiotic regimen was changed to zosyn and vancomycin. On hospital day 16 he had a right thoracotomy and decortication and placement of two chest tubes. Chest tubes were removed by hospital day 18. The patient was discharged from the hospital 5 days later on augmentin to complete a 3 week course.\nThree months following initial diagnosis of pHUS, the patient developed cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed active bleeding in the rectum. The patient was observed, and his bleeding appeared to self-resolve. He was not given blood products and was discharged on the next day, 3 days prior to his presentation at our medical center.\nOn the evening of the fourth day postprocedure, the patient again developed lightheadedness and bright red blood per rectum. He was brought to our Emergency Department for further evaluation. He had not taken any medications. His temperature was 36.3\u2103, his heart rate 110 per minute, his blood pressure 109/62 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. On physical examination, he appeared diaphoretic and pale; no abdominal tenderness was found. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL. The platelets, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time were within their normal ranges. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed active bleeding in the anterior rectum. Over the next 12 hours, the patient had eight episodes of large-volume bright red blood per rectum and clots. He received seven units of blood and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Although the patient was alert and oriented at the time of presentation, he subsequently developed syncope with poor arousability and was intubated in our intensive care unit for airway protection. A 500-mL tap water enema was administered, and he underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy.\nOn sigmoidoscopy, bright red blood and clots were noted from the rectum to 15 cm of intubation, where normal mucosa was visualized. On the anterior aspect of the rectum, at 1 to 2 cm from the dentate line, an approximately 3-mm ulcerated lesion was noted overlying a raised lesion that was pulsatile (). Six mililiters of 0.0001% epinephrine solution was injected circumferentially around this lesion, with immediate brisk bleeding noted at the injection sites. Although clipping and/or cautery were initially considered for hemostasis, on retroflexion, the lesion was apparently contiguous with what appeared to be a large internal hemorrhoid (). As such, band ligation (Speedband Superview Super 7, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) was performed using a single band around the site of the ulcerated lesion, with successful hemostasis being achieved (). After the procedure, the patient had no further signs of bleeding and showed stable hemoglobin levels on serial testing. He was successfully extubated within 24 hours and was discharged 5 days later.\n\nWhat is the patient's Centor Score?", "output": "### Response:\n-1", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 66-year-old man visited our hospital, Asan Medical Center, due to a cough persisting for 5 months. Seven years earlier, he had been treated for pan-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which lasted for 9 months. This treatment was successful but a chest X-ray (CXR) at the time of treatment completion showed parenchymal destructive lesions, with fibrotic changes in the right upper lung field (). He also suffered from a mild chronic cough. He remained relatively well thereafter. A CXR taken about 1 year earlier showed no significant changes in the TB-destroyed lung. However, his cough became aggravated 6 months prior to presentation at our clinic.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient was alert and not in distress. His vital signs were as follows: temperature, 35.6\u2103; blood pressure, 123/78 mm Hg; pulse, 63 beats per minute (with a regular rhythm); and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in the right upper anterior chest. Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 7,500/mm3 (67% neutrophils); hemoglobin, 12.6 g/dL; and a platelet count of 268,000/mm3. Routine chemical laboratory data were all within the normal ranges. The patient was negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus.\nCompared with the CXR taken 6 years earlier, his CXR showed increased infiltration of the right middle lung field, with small nodular densities (). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a newly developed segmental centrilobular nodular lesion in the right lung (). Smears and cultures of multiple sputum specimens were positive for acid-fast bacilli, which a GenoType Mycobacterium Assay (Hain Diagnostika, Nehren, Germany) identified as M. malmoense ().\nBased on these clinical and laboratory data, the patient was given a diagnosis of lung disease caused by M. malmoense, according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. M. malmoense was subjected to several rounds of drug susceptibility testing; however, all failed due to contamination. The patient was treated with oral isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and clarithromycin, and his symptoms improved rapidly. Sputum culture conversion was observed after 2 months. Due to the improved clinical course, moxifloxacin was stopped 8 months after initiation. Also, we had to discontinue ethambutol after 10 months due to the onset of optic neuropathy. Treatment was completed 12 months after achieving sputum culture conversion (i.e., treatment lasted 14 months in total). A CXR and CT scan taken 12 months after the start of treatment showed an improvement in the lung lesions (). The patient received regular follow-up for 3 months after treatment completion with no relapse of M. malmoense infection.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n93.0", "task": "calc"}

Physical examination revealed a sleepy but easily arousable infant with a heart rate of 160 per minute, a respiration rate of 32 per minute and a body temperature of 37.7\u00b0C. On all four extremities, a blood pressure of 135/95 mm Hg was measured, a value above the 99th percentile (P) by age and height (e.g. P 95th is 103/56 mm Hg). There were no signs of meningitis or intracranial hypertension, no abnormalities in sensibility and strength, and reflexes were normal. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed no heart murmurs, and breath sounds were normal. The abdomen was not painful to palpation and there were no masses. No edema was found, and the skin was unremarkable. Based on the combination of hypertensive crisis and the neurological findings, the diagnosis of malignant hypertension was made and the patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit for evaluation and intravenous antihypertensive therapy [, , ]. Nicardipine at 1 mcg/kg/min lowered his blood pressure to an acceptable level of 105/55 mm Hg (P 95th) within a few hours.\nLaboratory results showed a normal complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes (Na 137 mmol/l, K 4.1 mmol/l, Cl 104 mmol/l), creatinine 13 \u00b5mol/l, urea 3.6 mmol/l and glucose 5.6 mmol/l. Glomerular filtration rate was 118 ml/min, and blood lactate as well as ammonia levels were normal. An arterial blood gas analysis revealed a mild meta-bolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (pH 7.40, bicarbonate 17.7 mmol/l, pCO2 29 mm Hg).\nA computed tomography of the brain revealed no intracranial bleeding, no tumor and no signs of elevated intracranial pressure. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys without hydronephrosis, and Doppler studies were unremarkable. On the ultrasound, an abdominal mass with the characteristic \u2018target sign\u2019 of an ileocecal intussusception was visualized in the right lower quadrant (fig. ). Radiographically guided hydrostatic reduction with water-soluble contrast failed. Laparotomy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of intussusception. After repositioning, intestinal perfusion was adequate and bowel resection was not necessary. The anesthetics used during the surgery had no major influence on the blood pressure.

There was also loss of appetite and she had lost 7 kg of weight in the last 2 months. She was of mixed European/African ethnicity, and her previous medical history mentioned an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for which she used methylphenidate 10 mg daily. Her psychiatric history showed a short period of paranoid features when she was 20 years old, possibly induced by overuse of methylphenidate.\nOn physical examination there was a body temperature of 34.8\u00b0C, an RR of 95/57 mm Hg, and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. She had symptoms of bradyphrenia, bradykinesia, and slowed, halting speech and was disorientated in time and place. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 26/30. The remaining physical and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Extensive ancillary testing was performed. Laboratory testing showed a leukocytosis of 27.7 \u00d7 109/L, a C-reactive protein level of 2.1 mg/L, and a mild hypernatremia of 148 mmol/L. Her thyroid function was normal and there were no vitamin deficiencies. A urine sample showed no abnormalities and drug testing was negative. HIV and lues screening was negative. A brain CT scan was normal.\nShe was admitted to our neurology ward, but after 2 days she was transferred to our medical psychiatric ward because of progressive confused behavior. The psychiatrist suspected a first psychotic episode with catatonic features; methylphenidate was discontinued and she was treated with lorazepam 0.5 mg twice a day. An antipsychotic drug was not yet started, because a somatic cause of her behavior had not been ruled out completely. She then developed hypothermia (32.6\u00b0C) and hypercapnia and was therefore transferred to the intensive care unit because of a suspected autonomic dysregulation. On the intensive care unit, her mental status deteriorated. A brain MRI showed an abnormal hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of the hypothalamus (Fig. ) and, to a lesser extent, of the right optic nerve, with enhancement after gadolinium. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed a mild pleocytosis of 60 cells/\u00b5L, a normal protein level of 0.45 g/L, and a normal glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L.\nThe differential diagnosis at that moment included hypothalamic encephalitis either caused by an autoimmune disorder or of viral origin, a systemic autoimmune disease, or a paraneoplastic disorder. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures showed no abnormalities and the paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no signs of sarcoidosis or an underlying malignancy. Anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies were absent, ruling out systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-related antigen B (anti-SSB) antibodies were positive, but in combination with a negative test for anti-SSA and normal findings at a lip biopsy, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome was considered highly unlikely.\nThe patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy for 3 days, at 1,000 mg per day, which resulted in resolution of the hypothermia and hypercapnia. A second cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an IgG index of 0.52 with oligoclonal bands. Considering all the normal results on testing and the prompt reaction to steroids, an NMOSD was considered and was confirmed by positive tests for serum anti-AQP4 antibody. After the 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone, we continued treatment with oral prednisolone at 30 mg twice a day and azathioprine at 50 mg twice a day. Because she developed apraxia and hypomanic features such as hypersexuality and overeating in combination with the preexisting cognitive and behavioral problems, she was retransferred to the medical psychiatric ward and treated with haloperidol at 2.5 mg and with lorazepam. Her MMSE score at that moment was 14/30. An ophthalmologist confirmed vision of 0.5/200 and 20/25, respectively, in the right and the left eye. On treatment with haloperidol and lorazepam, the hypomanic symptoms and delusional thinking subsided. After 6 weeks, she was discharged to a rehabilitation center with severe memory and visual problems. Oral prednisolone was continued in a 22-month tapering schedule; azathioprine was continued at 50 mg twice a day. After a couple of weeks in rehabilitation, she was again transferred to a psychiatric unit with a compulsive eating disorder and aggressive behavior probably due to a combination of treatment with prednisolone and a brain injury caused by the initial brain lesions. A repeat MRI scan 3 months later showed almost complete recovery of the hypothalamic lesions, and there were no signs of new disease activity.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Two years prior, she was diagnosed with MDS of the refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 subtype, according to World Health Organization classification. The International Prognostic Scoring System score was 3 and classified as high risk group. Following induction chemotherapy with azacitidine until the 16th cycle, the patient achieved complete remission. Chromosome analysis showed hyperdiploid clone with complex karyotypic abnormalities including trisomy 8 (55,XX, +1, +4, del(5)(q13), +6, +8, +9, +10, +14, +21, +22[17]/46, XX[3]).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 years previously. Serum glucose level was controlled without complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy including microalbuminuria.\nLaboratory test revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin concentration, 6.0 g/dL; white blood cell count, 2.25\u00d7109/L; platelet count, 12\u00d7109/L); slightly abnormal serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, 213 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 26 mg/dL; triglyceride, 284 mg/dL); normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time; and elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product and D-dimer. Thrombolytic therapy and antiplatelet drugs were contraindicated due to thrombocytopenia. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no abnormal result.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. Her initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 6 (facial palsy 1, right arm motor 4, dysarthria 1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed scattered acute infarction in the left cerebral deep white matter near primary motor cortex-white matter junction, corona radiata, and angular gyrus. Brain magnetic resonance angiography indicated severe stenosis and/or acute thrombosis of left proximal M1.

The result of follow-up MMT was grade 0 at right whole upper limb, grade 1 at right hip and knee, and grade 2 at right ankle. Further radiologic study was not done despite possibility of progression. During the hospitalization period, conservative treatments alone were administered including intravenous hydration, transfusion, antibiotics for the recurrent infection, and bedside rehabilitative therapy. Additional chemotherapy was not possible because of poor general condition. On the 44th day of admission, the patient was transferred to a secondary referral hospital.

Her pain aggravated monthly during her menstruation; however, she had a regular and normal menstrual flow. Her personal history and family history were not significant, and she had no previous sexual history. Different kinds of anti-inflammatory medications had been prescribed for her during the past two years. The patient had also received oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for two months, but none of the medications had been significantly effective. On physical examination, she was a well-developed girl with normal vital signs. She showed normal pubertal development with a height of 160 centimeters (percentile: 47%) and weight of 48 kilograms (percentile: 43%), and normal adrenarche and thelarche (stage 4). Pelvic examination of the external genitalia was normal with no evidence of imperforated hymen. No definite palpable mass was detected during abdominal examination. Ultrasonography was requested, which showed normal size and myometrial echogenicity of the uterus with normal endometrial thickness. There was evidence of a left-sided heterogeneous and mostly hyperechoic 35 \u00d7 30 mm adnexal mass with close contact to the left ovary (). Color Doppler showed some internal vascularity. A small right-sided simple ovarian cyst was also seen on ultrasound. The cervix and vaginal canal were unremarkable on imaging. For further characterization of the mentioned lesion, pelvic MRI was performed, which revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with significant enhancement after administration of gadolinium. The mass was located on the left side of the pelvic cavity, close to the left ovary and uterus; however, no connection to the uterus or ovary was detected. There was no pelvic lymphadenopathy or ascites. Based on the imaging findings, a paraovarian mass or a myoma was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy, and a well-defined fleshy mass was seen on the left side of the pelvic cavity. The mass was located just under the round ligament, close to but separated from the left ovary with no adhesion to the surrounding structures. Both ovaries and uterus were normal except for a simple right-sided ovarian cyst with no endometrial implants. The uterus had two normally developed fallopian tubes with no fundal impression or contour abnormality and two normal cornua. On close observation, the uterus was completely separated from the mentioned mass. Several collateral vessels arising from the left uterine artery, which provided arterial supply to the mass, were ligated during surgery to obtain hemostasis. Frozen section revealed normal myometrial muscle with reactive endometrium. Finally, the mass was successfully resected by enucleation and incision through the serosa. While performing complete excision, a chocolate-colored fluid flowed out from the mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged one day after surgery. She continued to be asymptomatic with complete resolution of the cyclic pelvic pain after one year of follow-up. Gross evaluation of the pelvic mass revealed a cavitated mass with a thick muscular wall, and pathological examination showed normal irregular myometrium lined by functional endometrium (). Thus, a final diagnosis of accessory and cavitated uterine mass was made. Retrospective re-evaluation of pelvic MRI demonstrated a well-defined mass with signal intensity similar to the uterus on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with central hypersignal endometrium and normal endometrial-myometrial interface (Figures and ).\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

At age six, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with the classical pattern of daytime postprandial hyperglycaemia, but paradoxical nocturnal fasting hypoglycaemia. Genetic testing demonstrated a homozygote mutation at position 119 of the mature alpha subunit of the insulin receptor, but a normal beta subunit. She is of African ethnicity, and was born of a consanguineous union between first cousins. There is no other family history of insulin resistance.\nHer diabetes was initially managed with Metformin (currently 3 grams/day) followed by a brief trial of added pioglitazone. She rapidly progressed to insulin, with a current insulin requirement of 2100 units per day (>50 units/kg/day). Despite this, her glycaemic control remains suboptimal, with an HbA1c of 75 mmol/mol (9%). She has a current weight of 36 kg, height of 148 cm (Z score \u22121.1) and BMI of 16.6 kg/m2.\nEnlarged kidneys were noted from six years of age. Ultrasonography revealed persistent renal sizes greater than two standard deviations for her age (11 cm diameter left, 10 cm diameter right), with poorly defined medullary renal pyramids, loss of normal cortico-medullary differentiation, and a mildly dilated right collecting system. There were no renal cysts or duplex system. Nephrocalcinosis was identified, and appropriate biochemical studies were done, revealing hypercalciuria (Table ). At age of eight years a mercaptoacetyl triglycine MAG 3 renogram demonstrated normal function bilaterally with an effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) from right kidney of 379 mL/min and left kidney of 404 mL/min (normal ERPF>300 ml/min).\nAt the age of eleven years she presented with recurrent left flank pain, associated microscopic haematuria, and albuminuria on dipstick examination. There were no features to suggest an infective or traumatic aetiology to her symptoms. She was pre-pubertal. Ultrasonography showed a right kidney of 12.3 cm, left kidney of 13.2 cm, with multiple bilateral renal calculi, the largest 10mm in diameter. The right renal pelvis was dilated (1.2 cm), and a simple 10 mm cyst seen in the left kidney. The bladder was normal. A CT urogram revealed a 2 mm calcification seen to the left of the true renal pelvis, suggestive of an intraluminal ureteric calculus. Intravenous pyelogram further demonstrated paintbrush-like appearances of the renal pyramids, consistent with MSK (Figure ). The patient had the most severe form of MSK, grade 4, with involvement of all the calyces in both kidneys [].\nHer nephrocalcinosis was actively managed by optimising fluid intake and a trial of thiazide diuretic.

He also tested negative for serum antibodies against tsutsugamushi, leptospira, and hantavirus.\nThe following day, MMI therapy was restarted after holding 42 hr because his fever had subsided and there was no evidence of agranulocytosis. However, 5 hr after he took the second dose of MMI (10 mg), abdominal pain and fever (39.2\u2103) developed again. At that time, laboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 5,580/\u00b5L (72.7% neutrophils and 1.9% eosinophils), total bilirubin of 1.84 mg/dL, and CRP of 26.0 mg/L. His serum amylase and lipase levels increased to 265 IU/L and 682 IU/L, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed that his pancreatic amylase isoenzyme levels were elevated. An abdominal CT revealed a swollen pancreas with peripancreatic inflammatory fat stranding, suggestive of acute pancreatitis (). An abdominal ultrasound was then performed, which showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or biliary duct dilatation ().\nAfter the withdrawal of MMI, his fever and abdominal pain improved, and pancreatic enzyme levels began to decrease and finally normalized (). We measured IgG and IgG4 to exclude autoimmune pancreatitis. The serum levels of IgG and IgG subclass-4 were in the normal range (901.5 mg/dL, normal range: 700-1,600; and 349 mg/L, normal range: 30-2,010, respectively). The serologic typing of HLA alleles revealed DRB1*0803 and DQB1*0601. After discharge, PTU (50 mg t.i.d) was prescribed for treatment of Graves' disease and his hyperthyroidism was gradually controlled without any side-effects.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n136.728", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nOn March 5, 2020, a-58-year-old woman was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient was previously diagnosed with COVID-19 on a screening test for throat discomfort 12 days earlier. The patient lived in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Korea, and had acquired the infection through community spread. Seven days before ICU admission, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and started lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg tablets twice a day and supplemental oxygen was started 3 days ago. Vital signs on presentation to the ICU were: blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, pulse rate 90/min, respiratory rate 32/min, and body temperature 36.9\u00b0C. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.383, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) 33.5 mmHg, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) 83.9 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) 19.5 mmol/L on high-flow nasal cannula (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2], 0.95; flow rate, 50 L/min). The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with elaborate lung-protective strategies. The PaO2 improved to 229.1 mmHg on FiO2 0.9, and we initiated intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg. A chest radiograph showed bilateral, multifocal, patchy consolidations in the lungs (). The C-reactive protein level was 22.9 mg/dL. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as well as sputum specimens were obtained for retesting at our hospital and reported positive for infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay.\nFrom the evening on Day 1 of hospitalization, the patient's body temperature began to increase, reached approximately 40\u00b0C on Day 2, and was followed by tachycardia and desaturation (). The fever was refractory to repeated administration of antipyretics. The body temperature increased up to 41.6\u00b0C, heart rate to 156 per min, and oxygen saturation decreased to 88% on FiO2 of 1.0. Nitric oxide (NO) inhalation was initiated and raised to 40 ppm, and injection of methylprednisolone 60 mg was repeated. However, arterial blood gas analysis showed PaO2 of 77.6 mmHg, and the troponin I level increased to 6.22 ng/mL. Considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as the last resort for treatment, we applied a surface cooling device (Arctic Sun\u00ae) with a target temperature of 37\u00b0C. From an initial core temperature of 41.8\u00b0C, the target temperature was rapidly attained within 4.5 hours. PaO2 was markedly improved to 318.2 mmHg, and tachycardia resolved after a few hours. The norepinephrine requirement that had increased up to 16 \u00b5g/min during the shock phase was tapered off. Echocardiography on Day 4 showed mid-to-apical-segment akinesia and depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 26%. The patient was extubated on Day 6 and TTM was stopped on Day 9. Other treatment details including antibiotics and steroid use are summarized in . On Day 12, SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR results converted negatively in all nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and sputum specimens. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued on Day 16, and the patient's cardiac function was confirmed to have recovered on Day 19 with an ejection fraction of 54%. A coronary computed tomographic angiography was also normal. A chest radiograph on Day 22 showed considerable improvement compared to the previous ones ().\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n3.0", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 30-year-old previously well Bangladeshi male was admitted to a local tertiary care hospital with a 20-day history of fever, chills, rigors, headache, myalgias, and anorexia. He had been suffering from nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice with scleral icterus and dark urine for five days. One day prior to admission, he was diagnosed with malaria on thick smear at a private hospital, however parasite density result was unavailable. There he was treated with intravenous quinine (750 mg 8-hourly x five doses) and azithromycin, due to limited availability of first line therapy of artesunate, before being referred for further management.\nPast medical history was significant for three prior malaria infections. His most recent episode of suspected vivax malaria was 30 days prior to admission, which was partially treated with an incomplete course of chloroquine. He had no history of jaundice, liver disease, transfusions, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. There was no family history of jaundice or iron treatments. He did not take any regular or traditional medicines. There was no history of betel nut consumption.\nOn admission, he had a temperature of 39.7 oC, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15/15, blood pressure (BP) 127/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 127 beats per minute, a respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93 % on room air, and body weight of 65 kg. He appeared unwell with pronounced scleral icterus, black urine, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (4 cm and 5 cm below the costal margin, respectively). There was no conjunctival suffusion or lymphadenopathy.\nAdmission peripheral blood smear confirmed a diagnosis of falciparum malaria (360 parasites/\u03bcl). Severity criteria included hyperlactataemia (lactate 6.8 mmol/L), hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 58 \u03bcmol/L), and 4+ haemoglobinuria (blackwater fever); hence the case was classified as severe malaria (Table ). He was promptly treated with intravenous artesunate 120 mg, 2.4 mg/kg body weight (Guilin Pharmaceuticals, China) at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h (four doses), in addition to empiric ceftriaxone 2,000 mg every 12 h, as per local hospital practice. After 30 h his peripheral parasites cleared with resolution of the fever and haemoglobinuria, and he was switched to oral artemether/lumefantrine (AL) combination 80/480 mg (Novartis, Switzerland).\nOn the third day of admission he developed fever, confusion, dyspnoea (RR 28, SaO2 90 %), tachycardia (HR 106), hypotension (BP 100/80 mmHg), recurrent 4+ haemoglobinuria with severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 32 g/L) accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, consistent with acute haemolytic anaemia (Table , Fig. ). Pre-transfusion peripheral blood smear showed no schistocytes and reticulocytes of 2 % (reticulocyte production index 0.15 (compared to RPI of 0.3 on day 3 in blackwater fever patients []). Direct antiglobulin test (DAT; anti-IgG and anti-C3d) was negative and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was positive. Glucose was normal. Blood and urine bacterial cultures were negative. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing and haemoglobin typing were not available. Human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology were negative. Hepatitis B antigen was negative. He promptly received transfusion of three units matched whole blood. Intravenous artesunate was substituted for AL despite parasite clearance due to the notion that the recurrent fever must be due to malaria. In total, he received seven doses of artesunate (total dose of 840 mg) and three doses of AL (total dose of artemether 240 mg, and lumefantrine 1,440 mg). Empiric amikacin 500 mg, 7.5 mg/kg 8-hourly was added on day 6 to broaden antibacterial coverage for potential multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria given his ongoing fever despite negative blood and urine cultures. The haemolysis continued for nine days and he required a total of 10 transfusions (Fig. ).\nOn day 10, bone marrow biopsy revealed gross hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia and no evidence of lymphoma, leukaemia, or haemophagocytic syndrome. Meropenem (500 mg 8-hourly) was empirically substituted for amikacin and ceftriaxone given his renal dysfunction to cover potential extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producers, and dexamethasone 5 mg 6-hourly was initiated for suspected autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The haemoglobinuria resolved two days after steroid treatment and ceftriaxone discontinuation. His haemoglobin slowly recovered, reaching 76 g/L by day 20.\nOn day 16, he had ongoing fever with right-sided facial pain and swelling. A large, 3 \u00d7 2 cm ulcer on the right upper hard palate covered with yellow slough and an area of necrosis was observed (Fig. ). The right maxillary sinus was tender on palpation. He had pain with right eye extra-ocular movements but no ocular discharge, proptosis, pupil asymmetry, diplopia, or decreased visual acuity. There was no nasal or ear involvement. A swab of the hard palate ulceration revealed long, broad, aseptate hyphal elements displaying 90\u00b0 branching consistent with Mucor, (Fig. ). Fungal cultures failed to grow. MRI showed extensive right-sided opacification and mucosal thickening of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with no radiographic evidence of orbital or cerebral extension (Fig. ). He underwent prompt surgical debridement of the oral ulcer and right maxillary sinus. His steroids were discontinued and he was started on oral itraconazole 100 mg 12-hourly until first line treatment with amphotericin B became available nine days later. Intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate 50 mg daily, was continued for 14 days with improvement of his facial swelling and oral ulceration. The patient was pleased with his clinical improvement and hospital care, however due to a family emergency in his remote village he left hospital against medical advice and could not attend follow up.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n105.0", "task": "calc"}

He had also recently been unable to get up from a supine position. The patient had no history of trauma or any familial inherited bone disorders. He had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 2 years previously and was undergoing treatment with metformin with a well-controlled glucose level. On physical examination, his height was 165 cm; it had previously been recorded at 167 cm. He had a waddling gait. Palpation revealed tenderness in the bilateral hypochondriac regions. Muscle strength was normal in all four limbs, although tendon hyper-reflexia was noted. A lump measuring 8 \u00d7 6 cm was found in the right palm (). The left lower limb was 2 cm shorter than the right limb, and the left lower extremity had an external rotational deformity. The remaining systemic examination findings were unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings revealed severe hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia, an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level, and an elevated serum intact FGF-23 level as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Kainos Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). The percent tubular reabsorption of phosphate was 77% (reference range, 85% to 95%), and the maximal tubular renal phosphate reabsorption normalized for the glomerular filtration rate was 0.32 (reference range, 0.89 to 1.34). Serum protein electrophoresis findings were normal. The patient\u2019s laboratory data are summarized in .\nA pelvic radiograph revealed a fracture of the left femoral neck. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy; GE Medical Systems, Chicago, IL, USA) revealed low bone mineral density at L1\u2013L4 (0.957 g/cm2; T-score, \u22122.0; Z-score, \u22121.5), the femoral neck (0.601 g/cm2; T-score, \u22123.6; Z-score, \u22122.3), and total hip (0.774 g/cm2; T-score, \u22122.9; Z-score, \u22122.1). Whole-body 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy showed focal increased uptake in multiple bones and joints (). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregular mass located in the right palm (7.2 \u00d7 6.2 \u00d7 3.3 cm in maximum diameter). The lesion had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a heterogeneously isointense bright signal on T2-weighted images. The tumor was broadly attached to the flexor digital tendons. Abnormal signals were present in several metacarpal bones (I/II/V), exhibiting low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a bright signal on T2-weighted images ().\nThe patient underwent surgical resection. During the operation, the surgeons observed that the tumor had penetrated the mesothenar and interosseous muscles. They excised both the tumor and related muscles. Histopathologic examination indicated that the tumor was an epithelioid vascular leiomyoma, categorized as a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor, mixed connective tissue variant. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed positive staining for vimentin, CD68, CD34, smooth muscle actin, and caldesmon ().\nOne week after removal of the tumor, the patient\u2019s serum phosphorus level was 0.95 mmol/L and his serum FGF-23 level had decreased dramatically.

Entropy\u2122 module monitoring (M-Entropy S/5 plug-in module, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) was used to ensure an adequate depth of anesthetic. Anesthesia was induced using 140 mg of propofol and 50 mg of rocuronium, and it was maintained using desflurane (5%\u20136%) and remifentanil (0.02\u20130.08 \u03bcg/kg/minute).\nSeventy-five minutes after the induction of anesthesia, a sudden increase in the entropy indices up to 85 for SE and 95 for RE was noticed. Thereafter, despite an adjustment of desflurane up to 7% to 8%, SE and RE generally remained above 80 for 100 minutes throughout the main procedure with some fluctuations in accordance with the degree of surgical stimulation. We confirmed that the Entropy\u2122 sensor was correctly placed on the patient\u2019s forehead, and the sensor, which was re-checked, passed with normal results. Until this time, additional rocuronium had not been administered since anesthesia induction, and thus, we suspected that the increase in SE/RE may have resulted from increased EMG activity, although the patient did not move during surgery. After 10 mg of rocuronium was injected (, the first red arrow), SE/RE dramatically decreased to 30 to 40. At this time, train-of-four (TOF) monitoring (M-NMT Mechanosensor\u2122, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) was started in the right adductor pollicis and the TOF ratio was 10. About 45 minutes later, a TOF ratio reached 70 and SE and RE also increased to 70 to 80. SE/RE returned to above 80 for about 30 minutes. After a second injection of 10 mg of rocuronium (, the second red arrow), SE/RE suddenly decreased to 30 to 40. About 20 minutes later, the patient\u2019s blood pressure exceeded 150/90 mmHg and his heart rate increased to 110 beats/minute. Thus, the remifentanil infusion rate was adjusted from 0.08 to 0.12 \u03bcg/kg/minute (, blue arrow). Thereafter, SE/RE did not increase by more than 50, even though the TOF ratio increased to above 70 and no more rocuronium was injected until the end of surgery.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure (systolic pressure range, 100\u2013145 mmHg; diastolic pressure range, 55\u201380 mmHg), heart rate (range, 73\u2013101 beats/minute), body temperature, and oxygen saturation maintained at stable levels, suggesting an adequate depth of anesthesia during the rest of the surgery. Total anesthesia time was about 7 hours and intraoperative fluid balance was adequate. The patient did not complain of any intraoperative recall after the surgery.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish the details of his case. Ethics approval from the local ethics committee was not required because this case was based on routine clinical care using general anesthesia and it did not involve a human study.\nThe correlation between entropy indices and the TOF ratio using Pearson\u2019s correlation test was studied off-line after the patient\u2019s surgery. A two tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. In the period between the first rocuronium administration and increasing the remifentanil dose (180\u2013275 minutes, the first arrow to the blue arrow in ), the TOF ratio showed a strong correlation with RE, SE, and RE \u2013 SE (the difference between RE and SE) (r = 0.880, P < 0.001; r = 0.839, P < 0.001; r = 0.680, P = 0.001, respectively; ). Additionally, in the period between the first rocuronium administration and 80 minutes after increasing the remifentanil dose (180\u2013355 minutes in ), the TOF ratio also showed significant but relatively low correlation with RE, SE, and RE \u2013 SE (the difference between RE and SE) (r = 0.693, P < 0.001; r = 0.708, P < 0.001; r = 0.418, P = 0.011, respectively; ). These results suggested that falsely elevated entropy values by EMG contamination could occur without sufficient analgesia.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n67.735", "task": "calc"}

Shortly after arrival of the medical team, she collapsed, and the cardiac monitorization showed ventricular fibrillation (VF) from which she was promptly defibrillated, and return of spontaneous circulation ensued. The electrocardiogram (ECG) after defibrillation showed sinus tachycardia with voltage criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.\nAt the emergency room, blood pressure was 105/72 mmHg and a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur was heard at the left sternal border on cardiac auscultation. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin showed a slight elevation (0.045 ng/mL).\nTransthoracic echocardiographic evaluation revealed LV enlargement (112 mL/m2), mild LV hypertrophy (maximal wall thickness 12 mm), hypokinesia of the basal and mid segments of the anterior and anteroseptal walls, as well as of all distal segments, and moderately depressed LV function.\nThe patient underwent coronary CT angiography that showed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). This was associated with a dilated right coronary artery (RCA) with extensive collateral network (Figure ). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterior wall and mid-distal anteroseptum, with transmural extension in the medium segment of anterior wall (Figure ). Furthermore, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed extensive peri-infarct ischemia involving anterolateral wall, middle segment of inferoseptal wall and distal segment of the inferior wall (Figure ).\nAn invasive coronary angiography was performed, and retrograde filling of the LCA territory through collaterals arising from an enlarged RCA was apparent (Figure ).\nDuring hospitalization the patient remained hemodynamically stable. She underwent surgical treatment by the creation of a poly-tetrahydrofuran (pTHF) conduct connecting the aorta and left coronary artery (Figure ). Communication between the main pulmonary artery and left coronary artery was closed with bovine pericardial patch.

He denied having urinary symptoms, fever, or other symptoms. Prior to his self-referral to CHF, he had visited another clinic where a chest X-ray, complete blood count, and renal function assessment were carried out.\nPhysical examination revealed a young man in mild respiratory distress. There were no skeletal anomalies or digital clubbing, and he was 1.76 meters tall with body weight of 68 Kg. His axillary body temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, oxygen saturation on room air was 91%, and he had bilateral pitting pedal oedema extending to the shins. He had regular heart rate of 104 beats/minute, blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, raised jugular venous pressure (approximately 8 cm), displaced apex, third heart sound with loud component of second heart sound, and grade IV mitral regurgitation and grade III tricuspid regurgitation murmurs. There were bilateral basal crepitations, soft and tender hepatomegaly of 12 cm below the right costal margin, and mild ascites. Other aspects of physical examination were not remarkable.\nChest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous congestion, and minimal left pleural effusion. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with bifascicular block (complete right bundle branch block plus left posterior hemiblock). Echocardiogram (see Figures and ) revealed absent interatrial septum (common atrium) with deformed mitral and tricuspid valves (MV and TV, resp.), which were severely regurgitant. The right ventricle was dilated with a basal diameter of 50 mm, but left ventricular (LV) end diastolic diameter was normal (39 mm), and LV was hypercontractile (LV ejection fraction (LVEF) = 90%). His mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure was approximately 36.8 mmHg, consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary veins and superior vena were normally positioned. The pericardium was mildly thickened with moderate pericardial effusion (average echo free space = 15.5 mm). Fibrin strands were not seen within the effusion. The complete blood count showed total white blood cell count of 11.6 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils = 8.3 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocytes = 2.6 \u00d7 109/L, haemoglobin = 16.3 g/dL, haematocrit = 54.9%, and platelets = 522 \u00d7 109/L. Serum creatinine was 92 \u03bcmol/L, and other renal function parameters were all normal.\nThe overall diagnosis was ADHF with preserved LVEF and progressive secondary pulmonary hypertension, caused by CA, associated with moderate pericardial effusion and indirect evidence suggestive of acute bacterial infection.\nAfter the initial cardiac evaluation at CHC which is an out-patient facility, the patient was immediately referred to the emergency unit of a tertiary level hospital in the city for admission and further treatment.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe participant we describe here was a healthy 24-year-old woman (height 174 cm, weight 56 kg) with no history of drug allergy and alcohol use. Laboratory tests conducted during screening on July 17, 2009, found that she was negative for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B. Her hepatic enzymes and creatinine clearance were within normal limits.\nAfter about 8 weeks of taking TDF-FTC, this participant complained of mild paresthesiae, numbness, and a tingling sensation in her upper limbs that was associated with pain and cold. The symptoms did not affect her daily activities, physical examination was normal, and she had not taken any medications that are known to cause peripheral neuropathy upon interaction with TDF-FTC. After an additional 4 days, she developed a disabling weakness of her upper limbs and bilateral weakness of power grip of grade 3\u20134 and fine tremors in her hands at rest and with activity. Neurological examinations found normal orientation in time and place as was her pupillary light reaction and fundoscopy. Muscle tone, reflexes, and somatic sensations were also normal, but there was a mild deviation of the mouth and the tongue to the left, on protrusion.\nAfter trial closure, analysis of her plasma and intracellular drug levels at week 4 and 8 were consistent with moderate adherence to TDF-FTC., At week 10, TDF-FTC was temporarily withheld due to safety concerns and as per the study protocol. The participant was given oral Neurorubine\u00ae (Vitamins B1, B6, and B12; Mepha Ltd, Aesch, Switzerland) for 2 weeks. Within 2 weeks after stopping the study drug, she was free of all symptoms. At week 12, she was restarted on the study drug according to the protocol. However, 1 month after restarting the pill, the participant complained of other neurological symptoms of posture-dependent numbness of her upper limbs. The numbness occurred while bending down and resolved after assuming an upright posture. She did not experience the earlier disabling muscle weakness or tremors. Her neurological exam was normal, and she continued taking the study drug. Her drug levels at week 24 (analyzed on stored samples after study closure) were consistent with low adherence to TDF-FTC.\nAt week 25, the study team decided to withdraw the study drug until neurologic exploration was completed. At week 28, the participant reported having taken a traditional herbal medicine, orally as a single dose. The nature of the herbal medication could not be determined by the study team.\nAt week 29, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain and cervical spine was found to be normal. Blood tests (performed at that time) revealed her lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 514 U/L (normal range: 230\u2013460), but her aldolase and creatinine phosphokinase were normal. The neurologist \u2013 with extensive experience in the treatment of HIV-infected patients \u2013 who assessed the participant observed:\nThe clinical manifestation in this patient was not the usual peripheral neuropathy known in patients receiving TDF-FTC. A typical TDF-FTC-related neuropathy starts with feet and only later goes to upper extremities. The fact that the paresthesiae occurs when the patient bends forward (Lhermitte\u2019s sign) suggests a possible lesion of the cervical spine, though MRI findings were normal.\nIn addition to the study drug, Neurorubine\u00ae, and the unknown herbal medication, the participant reported taking the following medications: 1) medroxyprogesterone acetate, from enrolment throughout the study period; 2) ibuprofen at week five for one day; 3) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid at week seven for 10 days; and 4) diclofenac at weeks 9 and 10 for 3 and 7 days respectively.\nOverall, for safety concern, the participant was managed as if she was assigned the TDF-FTC arm. The clinical team decided not to un-blind the participant\u2019s study group allocation, because this would not influence clinical case management. The participant\u2019s postural numbness gradually improved and was completely resolved by her week 36 visit. The participant finished study follow-up on September 28, 2010. Her symptoms did not reoccur after she discontinued the study pill.\nAfter trial closure, levels of vitamin B12 on her stored blood samples at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 all showed normal values: 625, 727, 744, and 791 ng/L respectively (normal range: 239\u2013931 ng/L).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n65.059", "task": "calc"}

There was nausea, vomiting, but no heartburn, decreased appetite for the last 5 months, and weight loss of around 7 kg in the last 6 months. There is no fever, headaches are often felt since the last 6 months and usually do not improve even after taking analgetics, and patients also sometimes find it difficult to sleep. There is no cough and dyspnoea; the patient often feels pain in the right chest which only decreases after taking analgetics. Urination is smooth, but the volume of urine was less, irregular defecation as long as this complaint.\nPrevious medical history: the patient was treated at hospital with a diagnosis of moderate differentiation of invasive squamous cell esophageal carcinoma, suspected lung and brain metastases with electrolyte balance disorders. The patient received chemotherapy 13 times and radiotherapy 30 times during treatment at a hospital in another country six months ago. Laboratory results of the last serum sodium after chemotherapy is 124 mmol/L. One month before admission in our hospital, the patient received a total of 10 bottles of 3% sodium infusion in another hospital. The serum sodium levels after correction were 111 mmol/L, 112 mmol/L, and 117 mmol/L, respectively. There was no history of swelling, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease.\nPhysical examination found vital signs within normal limits, good consciousness, and body mass index (BMI) 18.4 kg/m2. No signs of anemia and jaundice, no palpable tumor mass, and no lymphadenopathy were found. Thoracic, cardiac, and abdominal physical examinations were within normal limits. There was no extremity edema and abdominal ascites.\nThe results of laboratory tests are as follows: leukocytes 4,600/mm3, erythrocytes 3.35 \u00d7 106/mm3, hemoglobin 10.6 gr/dL, hematocrit 28.5%, platelets 99,000/mm3, MCV 85.1 pg, MCHC 37.0 gr/dL, neutrophils 76.9%, lymphocytes 20.1%, RBG 156 mg/dL, ALT 17 U/L, AST 14 U/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea 26 mg/dL, sodium 117 mmol/L, potassium 3.2 mmol/L, clorida 83 mmol/L, and plasma osmolality 216 mMol/kg. Other examinations found normal electrocardiography and abdominal ultrasound within normal limit, except for cysts in the right kidney (6.5 \u00d7 5.7 mm). Histopathological examination of esophageal tumor tissue biopsy was moderate differentiation of invasive squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. Thoracic CT-scan impression was sicculer esophageal tumors as high as the middle third with a mark of adhesions with the posterior portion of the aorta, no metastasis to lymph nodes and lung. The impression of PET-CT scan results postradiotherapy was increased FDG uptake is seen at a long segment of the thoracic esophagus. In view of previous radiation, considerations include esophagitis versus residual tumor. No increase was seen at the right hilum. The previously seen coeliac axis node is much smaller and non-FDG-avid. There is no evidence of hypermetabolic hepatic metastasis. A tiny nodule in the lingula is nonspecific. Increased uptake is seen at the right parietal brain parenchyma. This may be related to recent fall versus metastasis.\nBased on the history, physical examination, laboratory, and radiography investigation, the initial working diagnosis was esophageal carcinoma with SIADH. Management at that time was correction of hyponatremia with NaCl 3% based on the calculation of the patient's requirement. During treatment, the patient always complains of feelings of weakness, nausea but no vomiting, no appetite, headache, insomnia, and right chest pain that is temporarily improving by giving analgesics. There was no coughing and dyspnoea. Urine production per day was between 350 and 600 cc and irregularly defecating. On physical examination, blood pressure fluctuates within normal limits but once blood pressure reaches 160/100 mmHg, the patient has experienced a decrease in consciousness with laboratory results of sodium at that time: 108 mmol/L.\nLaboratory results for four times electrolyte control tests after correction showed sodium levels of 108, 108, 122, and 112 mmol/L, respectively, never reached the normal levels although correction of sodium with 3% sodium based on the calculation of patient requirement was given repeatedly; low plasma osmolality and urine osmolality higher than the plasma osmolality were also found in this patient. Furthermore, the management of SIADH was given fluid restriction; hyponatremia was corrected with 3% sodium based on the calculation of the patient's requirement, injection of furosemide 40 mg intravenous daily, tetracycline 500 mg twice daily. We follow-up urine production daily, urine sodium, urine osmolality, and plasma osmolality.\nThe general condition of the patient improves; complaints often felt during hospitalization have diminished. Physical examination results: vital signs are within normal limits, and urine production increases around 1100 cc daily. Laboratory examination results: levels of sodium are 140 mmol/L. Results of urine examination are within normal limits (urine density: 1.010).

The patient also referred nocturnal dyspnea. Family history revealed an older sibling with asymptomatic severe PE that required surgical correction (Nuss procedure) at 7 years of age. Our patient's sternal depression was visible since birth and symptoms had started earlier in life (6\u20137 years of age), followed by rapid progression of symptoms which were more notable in the past 6 months. Genetic tests were performed to rule out Marfan syndrome as well as other abnormalities. The physical examination showed a prepubescent female with a height of 131 cm and weight of 22 kg. Her chest revealed a deep, asymmetric PE deformity (\n).\nAs part of the assessment protocol, a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered (see\n). Chest CT evaluation showed that the sternum depression was posterior to the anterior vertebral column rendering the Haller and correction index, to the best of our knowledge unmeasurable. Other severity indexes were calculated: sternal rotation angle was 40\u00b0 and the asymmetry index of 58%, indicating a marked left-sided asymmetry.\nAs part of the functional evaluation, a spirometry and echocardiogram were indicated. The preoperative spirometry indicated an obstructive ventilation pattern (forced expiratory volume in 1 second = 74.4%). The echocardiogram revealed a dilated inferior vena cava, mitral valve prolapse with normal ventricular function, all signs of ventricular compression.\nAfter multidisciplinary committee evaluation, considering the severity of the symptoms and available resources, the indication of surgical repair was offered to the family. A MIRPE approach was designed. Right thoracoscopic visualization was achieved with a 0\u00b0 and 10mm Storz endoscope placed at the fourth intercostal space. Although an angled scope offers a better view, it was not available at the time of the repair. This was followed by placement of a midsternum 7.5 mm cannulated bone screw (Laffitte). This would generate upward traction that would allow better visualization of the substernal dissection plane. After careful dissection, two 9-inch steel bars were slipped under the sternum through the fifth and seventh intercostal space following the Nuss procedure indications. Two steel bars and stabilizers on both sides of the bar were placed to fully correct the deformity and to prevent bar displacement.\nPostoperative care was uneventful allowing for a painless and quick recovery. At the 2 months' spirometry evaluation, an improvement in FEV1 and other parameters was observed (see\n), and cardiac compression signs disappeared on cardiac ultrasound. The patient referred that most symptoms had disappeared by the 3-month follow-up (nocturnal dyspnea and shortness of breath upon slight exertion), with great improvement in quality of life. Exercise was restricted during the initial 4 months, after which normal activity other than contact-sports were allowed. The desired sternum shape was achieved, with slight overcorrection noticed around 18 months postoperatively. The steel bars were removed after a 2-year period. At the 3-month follow-up, all of the patient's exercise intolerance had disappeared, and she was now more physically active. Postoperative bar removal imaging showed an acceptable correction of the deformity (see\nand\n).

Apart from the hemichorea involving the left side of the face and upper and lower extremities, her neurological examination was unremarkable; with normal higher mental function, and normal cranial and sensory nerve examination.\nOn admission, she was hyperglycemic with a random serum glucose of 30.3 mmol/L, (normal level <6.5 mmol/L); and her glycosylated hemoglobin was 13.5%, normal level=4-6%. Urine was negative for ketones. Expectedly, serum potassium was 5.6 mmol/L (normal level=3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and sodium was 133 mmol/L, (normal level=135-145 mmol/L), but other electrolytes were normal. Her blood count, coagulation profile, liver function tests, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were all within normal. Lipid profile showed dyslipidemia (cholesterol 9.81 mmol/L, triglycerides 4.61 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein 1.1 mmol/L, and low-density lipoprotein 6.61 mmol/L). Further workup reinforced the evidence of poor diabetic control; her ophthalmologic examination revealed moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and her protein to creatinine ratio was 2000.\nA CT scan taken on admission was normal. Non-enhanced brain MRI () was obtained the next day and demonstrated an area of hyperintensity on T1 weighted images; involving the left caudate, putamen, and internal globus pallidus. There was no restriction on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was normal. For glycemic control, she was started on an insulin regimen (bedtime insulin glargine and preprandial insulin aspart) with sitagliptin.\nInitially she was treated with lorazepam (2-6 mg/day) to control her HH. While lorazepam improved the quality of her sleep, it had no effect on the chorea in her waking hours. Valproic acid (400 mg/day) had no clear effect on chorea and was discontinued due to intolerance. She was then given haloperidol (gradually titrated from 1 mg/day to 8 mg/day) and clonazepam (titrated from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day). She showed clinical improvement after a few days with improvement in her daily activities and gait. Initially, there was more improvement in her lower extremities than upper extremities and the face over a period of 2 weeks. However, she achieved a satisfactory glycemic control, with a fasting serum glucose ranging from 6 to 7.8 mmol/L. With the initiation of neuroleptics and the glycemic control, the hemichorea steadily improved. She was discharged and followed up at an outpatient clinic. Three months later, she was in stable condition and had no recurrence of chorea.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n143.572", "task": "calc"}

She received induction chemotherapy and subsequently autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient attained complete remission and started maintenance regimen with carfilzomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone. After three monthly cycles of this regimen, dose of carfilzomib was increased to 56 mg/sq m, when she developed progressive shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. She experienced no chest pain, cough, or fever. Her shortness of breath had become progressively worse until it became disabling and she presented to the emergency department for evaluation.\nOn initial examination, she was found to be having acute hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 43-year-old woman, divorced with no children, on leave from her work as a pharmacist, had a longstanding history of severe and refractory AN, binge-eating/purging type. She was first hospitalized at 15 years of age with restricted eating and extreme weight loss (height, 157 cm, weight, 31.7 kg; BMI, 12.9) and diagnosed with AN. She began to engage in binge-eating episodes shortly thereafter, and added self-induced vomiting and some compensatory exercise at age 20. Her first episode of depression developed at the same age. The frequency and severity of depressive episodes, binge-eating and self-induced vomiting increased steadily over the next 20 years.\nThere was a marked increase in illness severity in 2007, when her husband of 8 years ended their relationship. For approximately 4 years thereafter, she engaged in one to two binge-eating episodes per day, each lasting at least 5 h, followed immediately by purging by vomiting. By 2010, she was engaging in binge-eating and purging almost to the exclusion of all other activities including socializing, paying bills, or doing errands. She reported that she would often remain awake throughout the night to continue these behaviors, and at times would have insufficient time to shower or dress in the morning due to the duration and intensity of the episodes. Her weight gradually increased into the normal range as a consequence of the severity of her bulimic behavior, so that her diagnosis shifted to BN. As of June of 2010, she was obliged to give up her work as a pharmacist due to the severity of her illness.\nThere was no history of hypomania or mania, panic disorder, obsessions or compulsions, delusions or hallucinations, or self-harm behavior, either past or present. She had never engaged in any substance use aside from one to two alcoholic drinks per month. Her past medical history was remarkable for osteopenia and poor dentition secondary to purging. Although there were no family members with any formal psychiatric diagnosis, her mother and sister were reported to have symptoms of MDD, and a maternal aunt was reported to have symptoms of AN. She did have a history of paternal physical abuse in childhood.\nFrom age 30, she had had unsuccessful trials of multiple SSRIs, trazodone, and desipramine, with add-on treatment using risperidone, quetiapine, methylphenidate, and modafinil. She had also unsuccessfully pursued several courses of intensive treatment for eating disorders, including four admissions to inpatient programs, six admissions to day hospital programs, and participation in mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive behavioral therapy, occupational therapy through a community outreach program, group therapy, and intensive treatment for her trauma history. In June 2010, she had attempted a day program at the Toronto General Hospital but was unable to significantly modify her eating behavior and was obliged to withdraw. In October 2010, at a weight of 47 kg (BMI, 18.9), she entered a 6-week inpatient treatment and was able to normalize her eating in this setting. However, she suffered a complete relapse 4 days after discharge to outpatient treatment, returning to twice-daily 5 h binge-eating episodes followed by purging, to the exclusion of most other activities. These episodes continued uninterrupted for the next 5 months until the beginning of her rTMS treatment.\nIn April, 2011, she was referred for rTMS to address her refractory depression, rather than her disordered eating. At her intake assessment, she reported a current episode of depression beginning in 2009, with daily symptoms of low mood, partial anhedonia, loneliness, highly impaired concentration and decision-making abilities, social withdrawal, decreased energy and motivation, and persistent thoughts of hopelessness and self-criticism about her inability to follow through with plans. She had thoughts that life was no longer worth living, but no specific suicidal intent or plan. She reported her depressive symptoms as moderately improved on a regimen of venlafaxine XR 300 mg once daily and desvenlafaxine 50 mg once daily, which she had been taking for the last 3 months. Her baseline pre-treatment scores were 26 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HamD17) and 28 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) self-report, suggesting a moderate to severe level of depressive symptoms.\nIn addition, she reported symptoms of disordered eating with twice-daily 5 h binges followed by purging for the last 5 months. She had a distortion of body image, describing her own appearance as \u201ctoo old\u201d and \u201cfunny-looking.\u201d Her menses had been present over the past year. At this time her weight was 50 kg (BMI, 20.3). She reported her current major stressors as being primarily around loneliness, separation from her husband, difficulty following through on her plans, and difficulty managing her eating and purging behavior.\nFollowing assessment, she was accepted for treatment and underwent a preliminary MRI, followed by 20 sessions of neuronavigated rTMS, one session per weekday, over 4 weeks. Neuronavigation employed the Visor 2.0 frameless stereotaxic system (Advanced Neuro Technologies, Madison, WI, USA) to position the coil at the scalp point at minimum distance from the coordinate (x 0, y + 28, z + 45) in standard space (Talairach and Tournoux, ), corresponding to DMPFC. Stimulation employed a MagPro R30 rTMS device connected to the fluid-cooled Cool-DB80 coil (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark), which has windings angled at 120\u00b0 rather than 180\u00b0 to achieve greater depths of stimulation.\nEach treatment session involved stimulation of right then left DMPFC with 60 trains of 10 Hz stimulation at 120% of resting motor threshold in 5 s trains with a 10-s inter-train interval, for a total of 3000 pulses to each hemisphere, as per a previously published protocol (Hadley et al., ). Prior to the first session, motor thresholds for flexion of the contralateral hallux were determined for each hemisphere using previously published methods (Schutter and van Honk, ; Hayward et al., ). The primary motor cortical region for the lower extremity lies on the medial wall at depths comparable to the DMPFC. Preferential stimulation of each hemisphere was achieved by orienting the coil at 90\u00b0 to midline, so that the direction of current flow at the coil intersection was aimed toward the hemisphere to be stimulated. As in the previous reports, this technique produced asymmetric motor activation of the contralateral lower extremity during motor threshold determination. The same approach was used for stimulation of left and right DMPFC during treatment.\nThe patient tolerated the treatment well. The only adverse effects were headache and localized scalp discomfort around the site of stimulation during the first 10 sessions, and mild pre-syncopal episodes on the first and second sessions. On both occasions, she was able to recover with a brief period of rest and complete the session.\nHer depression symptoms remitted over the course of treatment on both self- and clinician-rated measures, accompanied by marked and rapid improvement in daily psychosocial functioning. Her baseline BDI-II score, monitored daily, dropped from 28 at baseline to 7 after 11 sessions, and remained in this range thereafter. On the HamD17, monitored weekly, her score dropped from 26 at baseline to 0 by the end of treatment.\nThe more striking and unexpected outcome was that, after the second session of treatment, both the binge-eating and the purging behaviors stopped abruptly (Figure ). As previously noted, the patient had been referred for rTMS for depression and there was no prior expectation of improvements in her disordered eating. For this reason, standardized measures of eating disorder severity using standard scales are not available. However, even using the coarse measure of daily binge incidence, the degree of improvement was pronounced. Using a daily log, she reported complete remission throughout the remainder of the first week of treatment. During sessions 6\u201310, she reported a single binge-purge episode per day. These resolved once again by the session 11 of treatment, and did not recur thereafter. Subjectively, she reported that she found herself better able to apply strategies she had learned in therapy to redirect her thoughts and behavior away from binge-eating and purging. Specifically, she reported a reduction in her sense of urgency or impulsiveness when she had the urge to binge or purge, and an enhanced ability to make other choices and follow through on planned alternative behavior. As she continued to be successful in resisting these impulses, a sense of optimism and positive self-esteem developed, and her mood then began to improve.\nFull remission of both depression and disordered eating was maintained for a period of 64 days after the last session of treatment. On days 65, 70, and 71 post-treatment, she had a single episode of binge-eating and purging. She had reported the emergence of a significant psychosocial stressor (contact with her former spouse) immediately prior to this recurrence, and requested a repeat course of rTMS to avoid relapse. A second 20-session course of rTMS was initiated on day 82 post-treatment, by which time her BDI-II had increased to 20 and her HamD17 had increased to 11. After 5 sessions of treatment these had decreased to 7 and 7, respectively. Binge-eating and purging once again resolved completely after the first session of rTMS. She remained in remission from both depression and disordered eating throughout the rest of the course of treatment.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n49.665", "task": "calc"}

The patient denied any pertinent past medical or family medical history; though he took metoprolol and hydrochlorthiazide for about 1 month a year earlier, he was not taking either of these agents at the time of presentation. He denied use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and recreational drugs (including cocaine, heroin and phencyclidine). Initial physical examination was significant for elevated blood pressure (151/94 mm Hg) and pitting edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory analysis at presentation (table ) revealed renal failure (serum creatinine 2.6 mg/dl) and anemia (hemoglobin 10.8 g/dl, hematocrit 33.4% and mean corpuscular volume 85.4 fl). Urinalysis (random urine; table ) showed proteinuria, small blood and pyuria without bacteria. Proteinuria was confirmed on 24-hour urine collection that demonstrated nephrotic-range protein (25 g/24 h). Kidney ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys bilaterally with multiple cysts and this was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scanning (fig. ). A complete serologic evaluation, including hepatitis screen, was performed and was unrevealing (table ).\nInitially, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous steroid pulse (methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 3 days) and then switched to prednisone orally (1 mg per kilogram daily). A CT-guided kidney biopsy was performed and revealed immune complex glomerulonephritis with features of membranous nephropathy with crescent formation (fig. ). Despite treatment with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg), the patient's renal function declined and he became oliguric. Intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. In addition to oral steroid, treatment with mycophenolate (500 mg twice daily; escalated to 1,500 mg twice daily over 2 weeks) was started. Over a 5-month period, urine output increased in association with improvement in kidney function. Concurrently, serum albumin recovered to normal values and proteinuria decreased from 25 to 3 g daily. Because of persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria, cyclosporine 75 mg twice daily was added to his medication regimen. Over the ensuing 3 months, the patient manifested further improvement in physiologic parameters. Accordingly, prednisone dosage was reduced (10 mg orally per day) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was maintained at 1,500 mg orally twice daily and cyclosporine at 75 mg orally twice daily. Hemodialysis was subsequently discontinued and the patient has been off dialysis with stable chronic kidney disease stage 3 (creatinine clearance 45 ml/min by 24-hour urine studies).

Two episodes of balloon dislodgement occurred before the surgical procedure per se, the first when changing position to the left decubitus position, and the second when inserting the surgical instrument into the port, presenting as oxygen desaturation and loss of corresponding lung collapse, respectively. In both episodes the position of Uniblocker was examined by bronchoscope and was adjusted inwards to the proper position. Then the surgical lung remained well collapsed all the time through resection of the left lower lobe, around 4 hours long. The ventilator was set at volume control mode with FiO2 100%, tidal volume 8 ml/kg, I.E. ratio 1:1.5, and respiratory rate 24 /min. End-Tidal CO2 was around 28 to 38 mmHg, and SpO2 was always above 97% during the rest course of one lung ventilation. At the timepoint when the surgeon stapled the bronchus, the bronchial balloon was deflated and the Uniblocker withdrawn into the tracheal tube to avoid incorporation with the surgical staple line.[ The whole surgical procedure was then finished smoothly, and two-lung ventilation was resumed, with a total one lung- ventilation period of 245 minutes and blood loss of 20 ml without blood transfusion. The Uniblocker tube was removed immediately after he was sent to the intensive care unit. The entotracheal tube was removed by the patient himself one day later, but was reinserted hours later for O2 desaturation. After 10 days of ICU care, the endotracheal tube was successfully weaned. Though subglottic tracheal stenosis occurred at 17 days, deemed to be due to tracheal re-intubation, this problem was solved by laser coagulation surgery, and he was discharged home on day 19 Table .\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n36.0", "task": "calc"}

In 2002, some eruptions appeared on the skull. Two (2) years later, skin eruptions spread all over his body. At that time, he was diagnosed with psoriasis and prescribed topical clobetasol propionate. He had not been reexamined after that and has been using clobetasol propionate 0.005% routinely for 10 years. He has applied the drug to his arms, legs, and all over the trunk. Over the past year, he put on weight obviously (8 kg). He stopped the treatment 1 month ago, at the time of writing. He has been complaining of dry mouth and fatigue for the last month. On his physical examination, moon face, central adiposity, and purple-red striae on the abdomen under umbilicus were observed. There were scaly patches and erythematous plaques on the skull, interscapular area, sacrum, arms, legs, knees, and elbows []. Other systemic examinations were all normal.

According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome secondary to topical steroid use. For adrenal insufficiency, 20 mg/day hydrocortisone treatment was commenced, and for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement. As the patient had high blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia, and large waist circumference (101 cm), he was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, and a low-calorie diet and exercise were advised. Metformin treatment at a dose of 2000 mg/day was commenced for glucose regulation. The patient consulted at the dermatology department for his psoriasis, and calcipotriol pomade and emollients were prescribed. One (1) month after that, 1 \u03bcg tetracosactide i.v. was applied and cortisol levels were measured at 30 min and at 60 min.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 61-year-old African American female was found unconscious on the road after a suspected pedestrian versus motor vehicle accident. The patient was supposedly walking alongside a busy 4 lane road in the early evening time, when she was struck by a driver. EMS was notified by pedestrians, and she was found in the street unconscious at the time they arrived. There were no witnesses to the accident which came forward to aid police or medical professionals at the scene, and the vehicle involved in the incident fled. Specific details regarding the injury itself are unknown. The patient was intubated by EMS in the field and was brought to the local trauma center.\nAt the time of presentation to the ED, the blood pressure was 64/50 (posttransfusion and placement of pelvic binder; BP reached 150/110), heart rate of 119, and respiratory rate of 22. The abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended. No signs of rigidity or acute abdominal trauma were seen at this time. There was an open left lower leg fracture medially with an approximately 15 \u00d7 8 cm open wound with \u201cvenous oozing.\u201d GCS of 7 quickly deteriorated to GCS of 3. Rectal exam revealed \u201cno\u201d tone. There was no gross blood noted per rectum, but the patient is guaiac positive. There was no vaginal blood or blood in the urethral meatus; however, later the patient was found to have gross bright red blood draining from the catheter.\nHemodynamic instability upon arrival was apparent, and resuscitation through advanced life support (ATLS) protocol was quickly initiated shortly after arrival to the ED. IV fluids and trauma blood were given; 18 units of packed red blood cells, 11 units of FFP, and 1 unit of trauma platelets were been given to this point.\nThe patient was transported to angiogram for angiography of the vertebral artery and embolization due to pelvic bleeding. Images showed large amounts of extravasation of contrast in the right lower quadrant corresponding to areas identified on a recent CT. The right internal iliac artery was then selectively catheterized via interventional radiology procedures. Spot images were obtained after embolization, demonstrating a stop to the bleeding branch. An injection of contrast showed complete resolution of the bleed in the pelvis. The bleed probably represented hemorrhage from the inferior gluteal artery. A very tiny blush of contrast was demonstrated in the midpelvic region. It was elected not to embolize this area, as it would have required proximal embolization of the entire right internal iliac system. This action would have diminished the patient's opportunity for healing after pelvic reconstructive surgery. Narrowing of the right distal external iliac artery and common femoral artery was seen on fluoroscopy, thought to be due to extrinsic compression from a hematoma. The patient tolerated the procedures and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the process. She was transferred to the intensive care unit in what was considered hemodynamically stable condition. In summary, the patient had a hemorrhage in the right lower quadrant secondary to pelvic trauma which was successfully embolized.\nMultiple images were taken of the patient in order to direct appropriate surgical and medical management (Figures and ). A CT brain without IV contrast revealed a subdural hematoma, fracture of the left zygomatic arch and left lateral orbit, but no depressed skull fracture. A single frontal view chest X-ray revealed no acute disease/process. Shoulder X-rays revealed no evidence of fracture or dislocation. Knee X-rays revealed no evidence of fracture or dislocation. Tibia/fibula X-rays demonstrated comminuted fractures seen to involve the distal shaft of the left tibia. At least 3 fracture sites were noted in the fibular shaft which were also comminuted, involving the mid- and distal portions. Normal alignment remained at the ankle joint and knee joint as noted by imaging. Soft tissue edema was present at the left lower extremity. The open fracture of the distal lower leg had a large opening medially, which was approximately 15 \u00d7 8 cm in length. Bony fragments were present. All compartments were soft upon physical exam. A nonenhanced CT of the cervical spine and pelvis with additional 3D-volume rendered reformatted images was obtained. This displayed a minimally displaced fracture of the right C7 transverse process, traversing the right vertebral artery foramen. No traumatic subluxation was seen in the spine. A CT thorax with IV contrast via trauma protocol was performed, revealing no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary contusion, normal-appearing mediastinum and great vessels with bovine type arch, and no evidence of osseous trauma.\nA pelvic X-ray showed multiple pelvic fractures. CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast via dedicated trauma protocol was also performed. This revealed bilateral transverse process fractures of L5 and left transverse process fractures of L3-4. Comminuted pelvic fractures were evident. Bilateral comminuted acetabular fractures with protrusion of the left femoral head into the pelvis were seen. Bilateral pubic rami fractures were noted. Disruption of the left sacroiliac joint, anteriorly and posteriorly, was seen. A complex-free fluid was seen adjacent to the urinary bladder just below the pelvic brim on the right, likely representing blood and a pelvic hematoma. Via the Letournel classification of acetabular fractures, there was a right-sided T-type acetabular fracture, with communication at the anterior acetabular wall, as well as a left-sided T-type fracture with communication at the anterior and posterior acetabular walls. The left femoral head and floor of the acetabulum were medially displaced into the true pelvis. It was also apparent that there was a fracture at the junction of the left inferior pubic rami and left ischial tuberosity. Via the Young and Burgess Classification of Pelvic Ring Fractures, it could be noted that there was a pelvic lateral compression type II injury on the left, pelvic lateral compression type I injury on the right, as well as a pelvic lateral compression type III injury. A broad term to explain the pelvic trauma could be the classification designation as a \u201ccombined mechanical\u201d injury to the pelvis.\nDespite the numerous life saving measures enacted in the treatment of this patient, she subsequently passed away from her injuries. She went into a hypotensive crisis and cardiac arrest. The supposed location of hemorrhage leading to hypotension was thought to be secondary to a spinal injury to the transverse process of C7, causing dissection of the vertebral artery.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n123.333", "task": "calc"}

He was treated with an ORIF and plate osteosynthesis of the femur (less invasive stabilization system (LISS) plate, DePuy Synthes, USA) as well as ORIF and plate osteosynthesis of the tibia (distal tibia LCP plate, DePuy Synthes, USA) and fibula (1/3 tubular plate, DePuy Synthes, USA). Eighteen months later an atrophic nonunion was diagnosed and revision surgery of both femur (LISS pate) and tibia (distal tibia LCP plate) was performed. This procedure included decortication, re-osteosynthesis, and application of autologous cancellous bone from the iliac crest. Intraoperative samples showed no sign of infection. The fracture of the femur showed normal healing. Once again, the tibial fracture showed no healing tendency and the diagnosis of an atrophic nonunion (a) was made 11 months after the revision surgery operation and 29 months after the initial injury. The patient was referred for further osteological treatment of the tibia. Biomechanical analysis showed a correct anatomical reduction and therefore the decision against further operations was made. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was initiated and a teriparatide treatment was conducted over a period of 21 months. CTX increased by 83% after the teriparatide therapy.

At the pre-anesthetic clinic, the patient presented with a complaint of nasal blockade for 3 months without any fever.\nGeneral examination conducted by the anesthetist on duty showed strabismus of the left eye, rest other systemic examination was within the normal limits. No prior exposure to anesthesia was recorded. The patient gave a negative history of any drug use besides those employed for treatment of sinusitis. The body weight recorded was 50 kg and height corresponded to 155 cm and the body mass index was calculated to be 20.8 kg/m2. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 10.4, total leucocyte count of 11,000 and platelets of 156,000. Random blood sugar was 86 mg/dl. Vital parameters as noted in the ward chart on the day of surgery were within the normal limits and a temperature of 36.8\u00b0C (axillary) was mentioned.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room, routine monitors in the form of non-invasive blood pressure (BP), SpO2 probe and three-lead electrocardiogram were applied. Vital parameters prior to induction were within normal limits.\nAnesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam 1 mg, fentanyl 100 \u03bcg, propofol 100 mg and vecuronium bromide 5 mg. Patient was mask ventilated by a mechanical ventilator to achieve normocarbia with O2 and N2O and isoflurane (0.9-1 MAC) for approximately 3 min. The trachea was then intubated using endotracheal tube no. 7 mm internal diameter. After confirming endotracheal placement, patient was mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 400 ml, respiratory rate 12/min maintaining ETCO2 32-35 mmHg and an esophageal temperature probe was inserted. The patient was maintained on O2, N2O and isoflurane (MAC 1).\nImmediately following intubation, the ETCO2 rose up to 60 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, BP 130/90 mmHg, SpO2 100% and a temperature of 37.8\u00b0C were noted. The temperature within a few seconds rose to 38.2\u00b0C and within a minute it reached 38.9\u00b0C. Isoflurane was stopped and 100% oxygen administered. The surgery was halted and additional assistance was sought from the senior anesthetists in the operating theatre complex.\nIntravenous paracetamol infusion and cold sponging were started simultaneously. The ventilator settings were also readjusted to facilitate normocarbia. The ETCO2 came down to 53 mmHg gradually, but the temperature still continued around 38.9\u00b0C. An arterial blood gas (ABG) sample was withdrawn, which showed respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 52 mmHg, bicarbonates of 24 mEq and pO2 of 100 mmHg and K+ of 5 mEq/L. Supportive management was aggressively continued and vital parameters were monitored continuously. The patient was intermittently given intravenous midazolam 1 mg and fentanyl 50 \u03bcg as bolus twice and N2O was continued to prevent awareness.\nAfter 50 min, the temperature came down to 38.6\u00b0C and the ETCO2 normalized completely. In the next 20 min, there was a steady decline in the body temperature and it was recorded to be 38.2\u00b0C. The surgery was recommenced by employing intravenous propofol as an infusion in a manually controlled infusion pump while maintaining the patient on O2 and N2O along with intermittent boluses of intravenous fentanyl and vecuronium. The temperature showed a steady pattern of decline to 38\u00b0C and then to 37.8\u00b0C towards the end of the surgery. An ABG sample was re-sent which depicted a corrected pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 42 mmHg, bicarbonates of 22 mEq and pO2 of 100 mmHg.\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, the anesthesia was reversed and the patient was kept for further observation in the operating room for 15 min. The reversal was overall uneventful and the patient was shifted to the post anesthesia care unit where the vital parameters were found to be within normal limits and the axillary temperature was 37.7\u00b0C.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n47.855", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nOn 6 November 2008, a 53-year-old man presented to a nearby hospital with the chief complaints of epigastric pain and black stool. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a large deep ulceration in the gastric antrum. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes. The other lymph nodes were not enlarged. Positron emission tomography/CT showed abnormal accumulations of fluorodeoxyglucose in the gastric angle, para-aortic lymph nodes, pelvic lymph nodes, and prostate. They suspected malignant lymphoma or prostate cancer. The prostate biopsy showed prostate cancer, and a definitive diagnosis of gastric malignant lymphoma could not be made despite gastric biopsies that were performed every 6 months. There were no abnormal findings in the bone marrow biopsy. Because of the high-serum level of prostate-specific antigen (833 ng/ml) and prostate capsular invasion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they made the diagnosis of metastasis of prostate cancer to the para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes (cT3aN1M1). Treatment was initiated for the prostate cancer rather than the gastric malignant lymphoma. They started medical therapy for prostate cancer (bicalutamide and leuprorelin acetate). After medical therapy, enhanced abdominal CT showed that the para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes had become progressively smaller and the level of prostate specific antigen had decreased. On the other hand, upper gastroscopy showed that the gastric tumor had enlarged gradually. Once control of prostate cancer was achieved, they had planned to start medical treatment for the gastric tumor. The presence of Helicobacter pylori infection was demonstrated by the positive results of histologic examination, rapid urease test, and serology. They performed H. pylori eradication therapy.\nIn November 2013, the patient visited the authors\u2019 hospital with acute abdominal pain. He had severe epigastralgia that had started after breakfast. He was 58 years old, 166-cm tall and weighed 62 kg, with a body temperature of 35.9\u00b0C, a pulse rate of 81 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 127/82 mmHg. On physical examination, abdominal distension and severe tenderness were present. Blood tests showed normal results for the white blood cell count (4,900/\u03bcl), C-reactive protein (0.1 mg/dl), lactate dehydrogenase (200 IU/l), and interleukin-2 receptor (264 U/ml). Abdominal CT scan showed a large amount of intraperitoneal free gas and a fluid collection around the stomach, liver, and spleen. Also, the site of gastric perforation at the anterior wall of the body of the stomach was identified (Figure ). A diagnosis of perforation of gastric ulcer and pan-peritonitis was made, but details of the gastric lymphoma were unknown because it was his first visit to the authors\u2019 hospital. The results of imaging studies indicated a perforated gastric ulcer, and an emergency operation was performed. At first, a laparoscopic omental implantation repair was planned. On laparoscopic visualization of the abdominal cavity, purulent ascites and food residue were observed. There was a large perforation about 50 mm in diameter in the anterior wall of the middle part of the stomach body (Figure ). Because a large amount of food residue had escaped through the large perforation, removal of the food residue around and within the stomach was attempted but it was unsuccessful. Therefore, an emergency laparotomy was performed. A distal subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis and lymph node dissection was performed. Macroscopically, the gastric ulcer was 4.2 \u00d7 1.5 cm in size, and the perforation was 4.0 \u00d7 1.3 cm in size and located on the anterior wall of the gastric antrum (Figure a, b). It was ulcerative and infiltrative and was the excavated type according to Sano\u2019s classification []. Microscopically, a population of large atypical lymphoid cells diffusely infiltrated the full thickness of the gastric wall. Tumor cells were mainly centroblasts. Tumor cells diffusely infiltrated the muscle and subserosal layers (Figure ). Tumor cells and necrotic matter were detected around the perforation and ulcer floor. The lymphoid nature of these cells was confirmed by the strong positive immunohistochemical staining for CD20, CD38, and CD10; the slightly positive staining for Bcl-6; and partial positivity for MUM-1 (Figure ). On the other hand, the results for CD3, CD5, Bcl-2, and EBER ISH were negative. The MIB-1 labeling index was about 80%. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of germinal center B-cell-like type of DLBCL. There was no evidence of a low-grade MALT lymphoma. The number of metastatic lymph nodes was 3/31. Based on the Lugano International Classification, the stage was II1E (perforation and pan-peritonitis) since lymph node metastasis was present around the left gastric artery and greater curvature of the stomach and distant metastasis was absent.\nHe recovered from the operation uneventfully and was discharged from hospital 16 days postoperatively. He was administered rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy at the previous hospital.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

No history of previous medication, PUD or abdominal surgery, not a known diabetic, hypertensive, epileptic, asthmatic or sickler but has a history of moderate alcohol and cigarette use of more than 20 years. On clinical examination was an elderly man, conscious and alert but in obvious painful distress. He was afebrile, not pale, anicteric, not cyanosed, no pedal edema but was moderately dehydrated. The respiratory rate was 60 breaths per minute, pulse rate \u2013 120 beats per minute and blood pressure 100/70 mmHg. The abdomen was flat, tense, and with minimal movement on respiration, marked generalized abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, and rigidity. The examination of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and rectum were unremarkable but the prostate was moderately enlarged. An impression of peritonitis 2\u00b0 to perforated PUD was made and he was placed on omeprazole, tramadol, paracetamol, flagyl, ceftriaxone, hydrocortisone, and fluid hydration.

The patient was thereafter admitted to our emergency room at night. On physical examination, her body temperature was 39.7\u2103, heart rate was 135 beats/minute, and blood pressure was 83/39 mmHg. Several small scattered incisions from the liposuction and lipotransfer process were observed in the thighs, buttocks, breasts, and face. Besides, petechial skin lesions on the region of the back, lumbosacral, buttocks, posterior thighs with swelling and tenderness, and diffusely distributed erythematous lesions appeared at her toes and hands.\nThe patient\u2019s laboratory data were notable for a white cell count (WBC) of 2.8 \u00d7 109 cells/L(normal:3.5\u20139.5 \u00d7 109/L), hemoglobin 49 g/L(normal:115\u2013150 g/L), and decreased platelets at 49 \u00d7 109 cells/L(normal:125\u2013350 \u00d7 109/L,).

Her potassium was 2.86 mmol/L(normal: 3.5\u20135.5 mmol/L), calcium was 1.57 mmol/L(normal: 2.25\u20132.75 mmol/L) and serum creatinine was 101umol/L(normal:46\u201392 umol/L). Liver function tests demonstrated albumin level was 13.5 g/L(normal:63.0\u201382.0 g/L); the total bilirubin level was 87.2 \u03bcmol/L(normal:2.0\u201322.0 \u03bcmol/L); the serum lactate level was 8.1 mmol/L (normal:0.5\u20131.6 mmol/L); the creatine kinase (CK) level was 918U/L(normal:30-135U/L), myocardial-bound creatine kinase (CK-MB) was 17U/L(normal:0-16U/L), muscle-type creatine kinase (CK-MM) was 901U/L(normal:0-137U/L)). An arterial blood gas analysis showed a potential of hydrogen (PH) of 7.37, a partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 165 mmHg, and a Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) of 29 mmHg. Cultures of blood, stool, and urine obtained before antibiotic therapy were negative.\nShe was additionally treated with vancomycin and imipenem, blood transfusion, massive fluid resuscitation, and a series of supportive therapy. During the next day, the patient\u2019s condition worsened, a chest x-ray film showed massive infiltrations in both lungs. She was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with continuous pumps of norepinephrine and metaraminol, imipenem, and vancomycin as empiric anti-infective, blood transfusions. On the second day after admission, the patient's condition deteriorated, and each test indicator continued to higher or lower than the normal range; CT showed pneumonia, pleural effusion, and gastric retention, and blood gas analysis suggested severe metabolic acidosis. Gastrointestinal decompression tube drainage gives about 1500 ml brown liquid.\nShe was in a state of persistent hyperthermia that her body temperature peaked at 40.1\u2103; On the third night after admission, the patient developed rapid heart rate (144 beats/min), shortness of breath (25 beats/min), and confusion; blood gas analysis indicated PH 7.31, PCO2 50 mmHg, PO2 43 mmHg, lactate 3.5 mmol/L, blood oxygen saturation(SpO2) 73%. Additionally, the patient\u2019s urine was dark brown, and a large amount of exudation was drained from both thighs. Endotracheal intubation was performed with ventilator-assisted ventilation. On the 7th day after admission, bedside hemodialysis was performed because the patient's urine color continued to become dark, CK-MB, myoglobin, and infection indicators (C-reaction protein [CRP], Procalcitonin [PCT]) continued to rise. During the first 3 weeks after admission, a total of 3600 mL red blood cells, 1200 mL fresh frozen plasma, 4units(U) of platelet concentrate, 42U of cryoprecipitate coagulation factor, and large amounts of human fibrinogen and prothrombin complexes were used. The patient has gradually improved after positive and effective treatment, and the test indicators have gradually returned to the normal range (Additional file , which demonstrates the changes of patient\u2019s body temperature and lab test indicators from day 1 through day 14 after admission).\nAlthough the erythematous rush has subsided, peripheral ischemia appeared on her fingers and toes and gradually resulted in gangrene (Fig. ). What\u2019s worse, her buttocks occurred necrotizing soft tissue infection. By the time her body was strong enough to withstand surgery and the gangrenous areas became demarcated, surgical amputation of fingers and toes gangrenous areas on the peripheral extremities was performed; both fingers and toes were secondly covered with split-thickness skin after firstly artificial dermis grafts; her buttocks were grafted with split-thickness skin after twice full debridement and treated with VSD (Fig. ). During the period, antibiotics (vancomycin, imipenem, teicoplanin, tigecycline, sulperazone, polymyxin, Linezolid, phosphonomycin) and antifungal drugs (Caspofungin, Fluconazole) were replaced according to the patient's sputum culture, wound secretion culture, and drug sensitivity.\nBlood cultures were persistently negative for the growth of organisms, but Candida tropicalis was identified by the untargeted next-generation sequencing of sputum; Klebsiella pneumonia was identified by the untargeted next-generation sequencing of blood; Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumonia were detected in the buttock subcutaneous effusion culture. The patient experienced desquamation of the hand on the 26th day after admission (Fig. ). The skin grafts survived and the function of both fingers and toes recovered well.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 38-year-old male underwent a hiking tour on a hot, humid day in late July 2003. At the end of this exhausting trip he complained of dizziness, finally falling into an 'apathic' state. On the arrival of the emergency physician, the patient suffered from a generalized epileptic seizure. Subsequently, the comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 6 (E 1, V 1, M 4)) developed respiratory insufficiency and cardiovascular failure (blood pressure 60/20 mmHg, heart rate 166/min). He was immediately intubated (using fentanyl (0.3 mg), etomidate (40 mg) and midazolam (20 mg)) and transported to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU).\nOn admission, the patient was deeply sedated and under analgesia, but still suffering from hypotension requiring immediate use of catecholamines (norepinephrine). The patient had normal weight (body mass index = 24) and no significant previous medical history. The initial cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan in combination with CT angiography did not reveal any pathologies and, to exclude an infectious origin for the central nervous system dysfunction, a lumbar puncture was carried out yielding normal cerebrospinal fluid. An initial extensive laboratory work up revealed impaired liver function (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 312U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 244 U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 94 U/l (normal range: 10 to 66 U/l) and a prothrombin time of 60% (normal range: 70 to 130%). Serum creatinine levels as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were elevated (creatinine 2.6 mg/100 ml (normal range: 0.8 to 1.3 mg/100 ml) and BUN 30 mg/100 ml (normal range: 5 to 25 mg/100 ml)) indicating the beginning of renal failure. This situation was further complicated by rhabdomyolysis with elevation of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) (myoglobin peak level 33.124 \u03bcg/l (day 2), normal range: 0 to 116 \u03bcg/l) and CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4), normal range: 38 to 174 U/l.\nAt the time of admission, core body temperature measured by urinary bladder probe (Foley catheter; Kendall Curity, Mansfield, MA, USA), was 40.8\u00b0C. During the first 20 h of treatment, conventional temperature control methods including high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (acetylsalicylic acid 1000 mg and paracetamol 2000 mg) and opioids (pethidine 100 mg), as well as external cooling devices such as cooling blankets (Blanketrol II\u00ae, Cincinnati Sub-Zero, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Bair Hugger\u00ae (Arizant Healthcare Inc, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), which were applied for 8 h, did not lead to any significant decrease in core body temperature (Figure ). Because of subsequent deterioration of the patient's condition and insufficient conventional temperature control, an aggressive treatment approach with a novel intravascular cooling system (CoolGard 3000\u00ae and Cool Line\u2122, Alsius, Irvine, CA, USA) was begun. The heat-exchange catheter (Cool Line\u2122) was placed into the left superior vena cava and cooled saline was infused through a closed loop system into two heat-exchange balloons located near the distal end of the catheter. The temperature of the saline solution was adjusted automatically by the CoolGard 3000\u00ae, which is an external temperature control unit, according to feedback to the external pump/refrigerant device from a microthermister attached to a Foley bladder catheter. Target temperature was set at 37\u00b0C for the first 25 h of intravascular treatment and subsequently at 37.5\u00b0C. Target temperature was reached within 7 h at a maximum cooling rate of 0.6\u00b0C/h and 'cooling' was prolonged at this level.\nMultiple organ dysfunction and secondary rhabdomyolysis led to increased levels of myoglobin and CK (myoglobin peak level 33.124 \u03bcg/l (day 2), CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4)). To prevent imminent renal failure, forced diuresis was initiated and continued for 40 h using high-dose furosemide and fluids, resulting in an urinary excretion rate of more than 400 ml/h, leading to a fluid turnover of up to 24,000 ml/24 h. With this aggressive measure, we suceeded in avoiding the use of extracorporal hemofiltration and the renal parameters returned to normal values within 3 days.\nCore body temperature was maintained at about 37\u00b0C and subsequently maintained at 37.5\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.2\u00b0C) with the use of the intravascular catheter over the next 5 days (Figure ). Several attempts to stop the active cooling within this period (Figure ) led to an immediate steep increase of core body temperature, which forced us to prolong this very efficacious endovascular treatment. Finally, after 111.5 h, CoolGard\u00ae treatment was stopped, since most of the laboratory parameters had stabilized; the patient did not suffer from hyperthermia thereafter.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of severe heat stroke and to measure the systemic inflammatory response [], we analyzed levels of plasma cytokines and serum chemokines 60 h after admission. The results are shown in Table : soluble interleukin (IL) receptor (sIL-2R) 1500 pg/ml, IL-4 3 pg/ml, IL-6 204 pg/ml, IL-8 40 pg/ml and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) 38 pg/ml (IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium; IL-2R analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Immunotec, Marseille, France). On days 5 and 7 after admission, the values of IL-6 had decreased to 96 pg/ml (day 5) and 34 pg/ml (day 7), respectively.\nInitially diagnosed aspiration pneumonia as well as sinusitis maxillaris diagnosed on the initial cerebral CT scan, were treated with tazobactam/piperacilline and clindamycin. On day 3, somatosensoric potentials did not show any pathologic results. The patient was extubated on day 8 and transferred to a regular neurological ward on day 12 with neither signs of any focal neurological nor overt cognitive deficits. At the time of discharge from the NICU, laboratory parameters had returned to normal values.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n31.389", "task": "calc"}

At that time, she completed treatment with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole due to a penicillin allergy. However, the infectious workup remained negative throughout the admission. The patient remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and safely discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility.\nFour days after discharge, she presented to our emergency department for fever and hypotension. The team initiated the sepsis protocol, and the patient was adequately fluid resuscitated with an appropriate blood pressure response. Blood cultures were collected, and the patient received empiric antibiotic treatment and stress dose hydrocortisone with improvement in her mental status.\nThroughout the hospital course, her functional status improved significantly. The patient again agreed to placement in a subacute rehab facility on day fourteen of hospitalization.\nThe clinical picture was suggestive of sepsis with multiorgan failure in the setting of a new RTA. The patient continued on antibiotics, maintenance fluids with lactated ringers, started on a sodium bicarbonate drip, and was admitted to the medical oncology service for further management. Working differential diagnoses included sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, antimicrobial toxicity, and immunotherapy adverse effects.\nThe patient completed a seven-day course of antibiotics. Infectious workup, including computed tomography abdominal and pelvis w/o contrast, urine culture, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), was unremarkable. While tapering the stress dose hydrocortisone, the patient developed transient hypotension, fever, and transaminitis episodes. Per discussion with the infectious disease team and primary oncologist, the thought was that the clinical presentation was likely related to immunotherapy.\nDespite the acute renal failure resolution, the patient remained with a severe hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3\u22121, the nadir of 9 mmol/L), along with persistent hypokalemia (the nadir of 2.4 mEq/L) indicating a distal (type-I) RTA.\nAlthough possible, antimicrobial-induced RTA was unlikely due to the resolution of the renal failure and that none of the agents are known culprits to manifest acid/base disturbances []. Giving rise to a suspected immunotherapy-induced RTA, the patient was started on prednisone one mg/kg and transitioned to sodium bicarbonate tablets. Repeat blood work revealed an appropriate response with downtrending liver enzymes and increased serum sodium bicarbonate, indicating a resolving RTA.\nFurther workup revealed a negative autoimmune panel (anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B), ANA). SPEP, UPEP, free light chains, hepatitis serology, and thyroid function tests were unremarkable. Alkaline urine, a positive urinary anion gap, a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with low serum bicarbonate, and persistent hypokalemia suggested a distal-type-1 RTA.\nThe patient followed up with nephrology and oncology as an outpatient.

A red-and-white pill with a #5 inscribed (likely acetaminophen/oxycodone) was next to her, along with dark brown emesis stains. She was taking high doses of acetaminophen (sometimes exceeding 8 Extra Strength tabs daily) for back and leg pain for the past year. She used to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen but was no longer being prescribed this medication. She had been depressed and was previously on sertraline but had self-discontinued the drug for unknown reasons. Although she was never formally diagnosed with dementia, her daughter mentioned she had difficulty taking care of herself and was not eating, drinking, and taking medications appropriately for several weeks at least. She became progressively somnolent and was admitted to the ICU.\nOn admission, venous blood gas revealed serum pH 6.84, serum bicarbonate 5.8 mmol/L, and anion gap 22.2 mmol/L (Na = 138 mmol/L, Cl = 110 mmol/L), consistent with an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

As her calculated osmolality was 306.6 mOsm/kg (Na = 138 mmol/L, BUN = 52.6 mg/dL, and glucose = 213 mg/dL), there was an osmolal gap of 17.4 mOsm/kg. Her potassium was 7.5 mmol/L, but an EKG showed no peaked T waves (). However, she was given intravenous bicarbonate, insulin, glucose, calcium, and nebulized albuterol to treat the hyperkalemia. Given the elevated anion and osmolal gap and suspicion for ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion, 2 doses of fomepizole (670 mg IV Q12H) and 2 hemodialysis sessions were initiated while drug levels of these alcohols were still pending.\nSerum and urine drug screens returned negative for ethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetaminophen, and salicylates, but there were elevated levels of acetone (11 mg/dL) in the urine. Serum acetone was however not detectable. Her daughter later reported seeing a bottle of nail polish remover in her mother's house, though a direct ingestion history was not available.

Patient was stabilized initially in our emergency department, and radiograph of right femur showed displaced transverse fracture in the femoral shaft (). The other radiographic findings were diffuse osteosclerosis and narrow medullary canal. The patient gave a history of earlier episodes of fracture for which conservative treatment in form of native splinting had been done. Thus, a diagnosis of pathological fracture was made. On general examination, the patient had short stature and dysmorphic facies with radiological signs of generalized osteosclerosis and narrow medullary canal.

Radiograph of the skull was found to be widely open anterior and posterior fontanelle, with obtuse mandibular angle and separated cranial sutures (). Radiograph of the hand showed aplastic terminal phalanges with acroosteolysis. Abovementioned clinical and radiographic findings suggested pyknodysostosis as the most likely diagnosis. The patient was taken up for surgery within a week from injury. An intramedullary interlocking nailing was contemplated initially for fracture fixation.\nHowever, for this case, we preferred plate osteosynthesis because of the altered anatomy of the bone with a narrow medullary canal and severe osteosclerosis. Under Spinal anaesthesia, through lateral approach to the middle third of femur, a 12 cm incision was made. After deep dissection, fracture site was identified and exposed.

At 10-week post-operative, after patient has been started on partial weight bearing walking, the patient reported with the complaints of pain over surgical site. On radiological examination, patient was found to have no signs of union at the fracture. Patient was immobilized for one month, but even after that, there were no signs of union. Hence, an additional stabilization procedure was done in the form of plating with autogenous cancellous bone grafting. Bone graft harvested from ipsilateral iliac crest was inadequate, and there was heavy bleeding from donor site so that an additional synthetic bone graft substitute was used.

The patient reported no history of allergy. Also, there was no history of taking nutrient supplements. He has been working in recycling industry. There was no history of previous surgery or blood transfusion.\nAccording to the history of present illness, the patient started taking oral Za ga-do Kowa\u00ae from January 2016 for his constipation. He began to feel heartburn from around March 2016 and then started to consume Ohta-Isan\u00ae and Gasuto-ru\u00ae. From early April 2016, he frequently felt malaise as well as epigastric pain. Around mid-April 2016, he noticed yellowish skin. From May 2016, the color of urine was found to be dark and brown. The stool color became somewhat whitish.\nAlong with time and mainly from mid-May 2016, the extents of malaise feelings became exacerbated. On May 17th, 2016, he noticed considerable nausea, noticeable loss of appetite, and increasing order of malaise. On May 19th, 2016, he was admitted to a clinic for his complaints. The local clinic referred him to our department on that day, and he was admitted to Imabari Saiseikai Hospital, Ehime, Japan.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed that his height was 168.7 cm and weight was 84.6 kg. He was conscious of admission. The skin and bulbar conjunctiva were icteric. However, there was no murmur at heart or lung. There were marks of insect bites on extremities. Also, acne was found on the back. Bowel sounds were normal. The abdomen was flat, soft and without any noticeable tenderness. Liver and spleen were not palpable. He had a blood pressure of 116/72 mm of Hg. Pulse rate was within normal range (88 beats per minute).\nThe laboratory findings on admission have been shown in and described below: aspartate trans-aminase (AST); 988 IU/I, alanine aminotransferase (ALT); 847 IU/I, alkaline phosphatase (ALP); 320 IU/I, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (-GTP); 126 IU/I, total bilirubin (T-bil); 11.88 mg/dl, direct bilirubin (D-bil); 7.77 mg/dl, PT-activation; 58%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 386 IU/I, alpha fetoprotein (AFP); 73.9 ng/mL, carcinoembry-onic antigen (CEA); 2.8 ng/mL and PIVKA2; 30mAU/mL. The patient was negative for markers of acute infections (IgM type antibodies) against cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). The titers of anti-mitochondrial antibody titer [<20 (-ve)], anti-smooth muscle antibody (<20) and anti-LKM-1 antibody were negative. Serum mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) was 9.21 and serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was 2.31 ng/mL.\nLiver elastography showed VTQ: 4.0 m/s (3 times of average). This hardness corresponds to Inuyama classification F4 or more. (VTQ Reference standard value: F0 0.67 to 1.44 m/s, F1 0.81 to 1.63 m/s, F2 0.89 to 1.85m/s, F3 1.11 to 2.29m/s, F4 1.52 to 2.94m/s Multicenter 2012)). Fibro scan showed liver stiffness of 7.5kPa (just above the upper limit of normal).\nContrast CT showed the irregular atrophy of the interior ~ anterior compartment of the liver with features of fatty liver. Obvious space occupying lesion (SOL) could not be visualized in the liver. Volume rendering image of the liver revealed potato-like regrowth (potato-liver) (). Measurement of liver volume showed that it was 1428 mL in May 2016, 1007 mL in July 2016 and 1259 mL in November 2016. Along with the improvement of liver function, recovery of volume and augmentation of the anterior zone were seen.\nThe liver biopsy specimen revealed features of liver cell necrosis (multilobular hepatic necrosis) and infiltration of inflammatory cells containing relatively higher ratios of lymphocyte accumulation (). Partially bridging fibrosis, hyperplasia of cholangiole, and expansion of fibrous portal areas was also shown (). Vacuolation of the nucleus of liver cells (glycogen nucleus) were few and fatty depositions was negligible. Features of cholestasis and iron deposition could not be marked. The findings of liver biopsy were compatible with a diagnosis of DILI.\nAs all serum viral markers including hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, and E) were negative, we performed the drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST). DLST for Za ga-do Kowa\u00ae and Ohta-Isan\u00ae were positive, however, that for Gaster\u00ae was negative. Cinnamon and fennel are components common to Za ga-do Kowa\u00ae and Ohta-Isan\u00ae, and they showed borderline stimulation (). Drug-induced liver injury score (DDW-J 2004) was four points.\nAfter admission, the patient stopped taking medicine. Subjective symptoms gradually disappeared. However, it was the sixth week after hospitalization, the liver enzyme rises and bilirubin re-elevation started. At one time PT became 45% and T-bil increased to 14.8mg/dL.\nIt presented a severe liver injury. After that, we were given ursodeoxycholic acid and late evening snack (LES) therapy. We continue treating in a protective way for liver, and the patient left the hospital after 15th week when the levels ALT and AST came below 100 IU/L, and the levels of serum bilirubin decreased to 4 mg/dL.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n64.759", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA full-term 4-week old, African American male with an admission weight of 3,535 g presented to the emergency department with fever of 38.3 \u00b0C and nasal congestion. The patient\u2019s mother reported no diarrhea, emesis, or cough and a recent diagnosis of thrush with initiation of nystatin therapy 2 days prior to presentation. Family history was significant for the mother, maternal uncle, and additional maternal relatives with renal tubular acidosis treated with bicarbonate supplements; however, the specific cause of RTA was never diagnosed. On admission, physical examination revealed a small appearing neonate with decreased subcutaneous fat in mild respiratory distress. An evaluation for sepsis was performed. Chemistry studies revealed serum bicarbonate of 5 mmol/L, serum sodium of 132 mmol/L, serum potassium of 3.4 mmol/L, serum chloride 114 mmol/L, serum creatinine of 0.49 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19.3 mg/dL, serum phosphorus 5 mg/dL, and serum magnesium of 2.5 mg/dL. Venous blood gas revealed pH 7.16 and pCO2 of 19 mmHg. Urinalysis was notable for urine pH 6.0 and negative for glucose. These results were consistent with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Fractional excretion of bicarbonate was appropriate at 1%. The absence of diarrhea, lack of evidence of proximal tubular dysfunction (normal serum phosphorus, appropriate fractional excretion of bicarbonate, and absence of glucosuria), presence of low serum potassium, and the finding of inappropriately high urine pH led to clinical diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis. Intravenous sodium acetate was initiated with improvement in serum bicarbonate levels. Renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no evidence of nephrocalcinosis. The patient was discharged on oral sodium citrate 8.8 mEq/kg/day (10 mL 3 times daily) and potassium citrate supplementation 4.4 mEq/kg/day (2.5 mL 3 times daily) with plan for close outpatient follow-up. The bicarbonate supplementation formulation included sodium citrate solution 500 mg/334 mg per 5 mL (1 mL = 1 mEq of sodium ion and 1 mEq bicarbonate equivalent of citrate) and the potassium citrate and citric acid solution 1,100 mg/334 mg per 5 mL (1 mL = 2 mEq potassium ion and 2 mEq bicarbonate equivalent of citrate). Both solutions contained 2% v/v PG.\nThe evening after hospital discharge, the patient\u2019s mother brought him back to our emergency room for concerns of lethargy. His mother stated that he appeared more tired and did not wake to feed. She noted that he was staring and blinking with his hand in his mouth, but denied noticing any shaking, tremor, emesis, skin color changes, or breathing issues. In the emergency room, the patient had a witnessed episode of staring without changes in vital signs, shaking, jerking, or emesis. CBC, CMP, and phosphorous levels were obtained and unremarkable. The patient was admitted for observation and evaluation of staring spells. During hospitalization, he returned to his baseline level of activity without initiation of anti-epileptic therapy and no additional staring spells were noted.\nUpon medication review by a clinical pharmacist, concerns arose for possible excess exposure to PG. The PG content of sodium citrate and potassium citrate supplementation was verified with the manufacturer and estimated at 222 mg/kg/day, higher than the WHO limit for PG in food additives at 25 mg/kg/day. This high dose of citrate therapy was likely being administered for ~ 6 days prior to the onset of his symptoms. Review of medications for additional exposure to PG revealed that nystatin, swabbed to each side of mouth for treatment of thrush beginning 4 days prior to admission, also contained PG. Oral citrate supplementation and nystatin were stopped, and intravenous fluid with acetate was started. Toxicology service was consulted and PG levels were found to be elevated at > 15,000 \u00b5g/mL, a level consistent with PG toxicity and expected to cause altered mental status. Measured serum osmolality on admission was elevated at 306 mOsm/kg, and the calculated osmolal gap was 25 mOsm/kg. Serum osmolality 1 week later was normal at 283 mOsm/kg. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous sodium acetate to oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (medication with no PG), and the dose was titrated to achieve a goal venous blood gas pH 7.35 \u2013 7.45. The patient was transitioned back to oral sodium citrate supplementation at 1.3 mEq/kg/day. Two weeks following discharge, PG level was undetectable, and venous blood gas showed pH was in goal range at 7.36.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was present. Cardia, pericardium and great vessels were normal. Lung fields were clear, and there was no pleural effusion.\nInvestigations were within normal limits except for raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucocytosis. The patient was put on IV cefotaxime 250mg twice daily (BD) and diclofenac suppository. The patient was taken up for intraoral drainage on emergency basis.\nPreanaesthetic evaluation was done on the patient She was febrile. There was a neck swelling on the left side. Her pulse was 140 beats/minute, and the SPO2 was 98% with room air. Her mouth opening was restricted to one finger. She had difficulty in closing her mouth as well. Mallampati score could not be assessed. Only the upper and lower central incisors were present. Cervical spine was normal.\nThe respiratory system had the following features. Trachea was central. Air entry was equal, bilateral crepitations and occasional ronchi were present. Rest of the examination was unremarkable.\nIn view of the anticipated difficult mask ventilation and intubation, all equipments for difficult airway management were kept ready, including that for emergency tracheostomy.\nIn the operation theatre, IV line was secured with 22-Gauge cannula connected to isolyte P solution.

She was 9 days from diagnosis of COVID-19 and had been treated with favipiravir and dexamethasone at the previous hospital. She had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\nThe patient was obese with a height of 140 cm and a body mass index of 36.5. In the emergency department, she had clear consciousness and her vital signs and were as follows: blood pressure, 127/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 77 beats/min; respiratory rate, 28/min; saturation on pulse oximetry, 98% in O2 mask 10 L. Because she had dyspnea, she was intubated, placed on a ventilator, and admitted to the emergency intensive care unit (EICU). Favipiravir was terminated and dexamethasone was administered for 10 days. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans at the time of admission are shown in Figure A. After intubation, the ventilator settings were: assist control pressure control ventilation; fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.4; positive end-expiratory pressure, 10 cmH2O, pressure above positive end-expiratory pressure, 15 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio (P/F ratio), 174\u2014indicating moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome. It was assumed that the transpulmonary pressure was not large, based on occlusion pressure and physical findings; the patient was maintained under spontaneous breathing. A tracheostomy was performed on day 5 after EICU admission. However, on day 6, there was a sudden increase in respiratory effort and the P/F ratio worsened to 100. Chest CT scans at this time are shown in Figure B. The patient was treated in the prone position with muscle relaxants and efforts were made to achieve lung protective ventilation; but, progressive hypoxemia was observed, with a P/F ratio of 72. Since the patient was not old, and Activity of Daily Living was Independent, the indications for VV-ECMO were considered through discussion among a multidisciplinary team that included respiratory physicians, infectious disease specialists, intensivists, and nurses. Pulmonary injuries were thought to be reversible due to the short duration of ventilator management. On day 7 after admission, VV-ECMO was initiated, as follows: right femoral vein drainage, 23Fr HLS cannula (MAQUET Cardiopulmonary, Rastatt, Germany); right internal jugular vein return, 19Fr HLS cannula (MAQUET); centrifugal pump, CAPIOX SP-200 (TERUMO, Tokyo, Japan) (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] flow, 3.4 L; 1430 rpm; delivered fractional oxygen percentage, 1.0; sweep gas, 3 L).\nAfter initiation of VV-ECMO, fluid balance was regulated using diuretics and the extracorporeal ultrafiltration method. To maintain safe and stable ECMO for a long period, anticoagulation was established using unfractionated heparin to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time ratio of 1.5. A platelet transfusion was performed to achieve a platelet count of 8 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. However, a subcutaneous hematoma appeared in an area unrelated to external factors, such as restraint and repositioning (Fig. A, 2B). On day 13 after admission, ECMO flow decreased abruptly to 1.2 L, with a simultaneous decrease in blood pressure to 79/48 mm Hg. With bleeding complications suspected, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the trunk was performed. Active bleeding with extravasation of the left retroperitoneal space was confirmed. TAE was immediately performed and ECMO flow and blood pressure were stabilized. (Fig. C) Six hours after achieving hemostasis, anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was restarted. However, on the following day (day 14 after EICU admission), ECMO flow again decreased and hypotension was observed; a bleeding complication was suspected. Contrast-enhanced CT scanning was performed again, and re-bleeding from the same site as previously was confirmed and immediately hemostated using TAE. Similar bleeding complications were observed on days 28, 32, and 37, all of which showed bleeding with extravasation on contrast-enhanced CT scan (Fig. D). The bleeding vessels were the lumbar artery (L1\u20133) and deep femoral artery. Each of these episodes required hemostasis through TAE and massive blood transfusion. Table shows the results of blood collection. No excessive anticoagulation was given. Increasing the platelet level did not stop the bleeding. The slight increase in thrombin-antithrombin complex, elevated fibrinogen degradation products, and platelet decrease in the presence of bleeding complications also suggested a bleeding tendency due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, but the rise in plasmin-\u03b12 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) was slight, so it was not considered. The patient was anticoagulated with nafamostat mesilate from day 34, but bleeding complications recurred and anticoagulation was discontinued from day 37, while management continued. After anticoagulation was stopped, no bleeding complications were observed. The clinical course is shown in Figure .\nThe patient presented with multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait lesions and neurofibromas over her skin (Fig. C). NF1 was suspected; and confirmed by skin biopsy (Fig. D). On day 21, bacteremia caused by Serratia was found and antimicrobial therapy was required.

He was hemodynamically stable and discharged from the emergency department with instructions to self-quarantine for two weeks.\nEleven days following discharge, the patient developed mild right hemiparesis, sensory loss, and dysarthria. Upon presentation to the hospital, he experienced rapid resolution of his symptoms with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) improving from 4 to 1 in two hours. On arrival, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 143/77 mmHg, pulse of 107 beats per minute, and 18 respirations per minute while saturating 100% on room air. After his symptoms abated, his only complaint was mild left-sided neck swelling he noticed following a burst of coughing spells while self-isolating.\nOn physical exam, the patient was alert and oriented with equal strength and range of motion bilaterally. Cranial nerves were intact with 2+ deep tendon reflexes throughout. No gait abnormalities, focal neurological deficits, ataxia, or motor/sensory disturbances were observed. Physical exam was remarkable only for minimal left neck swelling with no appreciable cervical lymphadenopathy.\nCT head showed chronic appearing hypodensities in the left subinsular cortex, suggesting small chronic infarcts. A nonocclusive thrombus was noted within the proximal left internal carotid artery by CT angiography (CTA) (Figure -panel A). Neither CTA nor carotid ultrasonography identified evidence of microdissection. However, multifocal ground glass opacities were visualized within the upper lungs. Chest X-ray however did not identify any acute pulmonary process. MRI brain demonstrated multiple small acute embolic strokes in the left internal carotid artery (ICA) vascular territory (Figure ). Labs demonstrated a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.4 (12.3-15.3 g/dL) and a mean corpuscular volume of 78.4 (80-100 fL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 0.4 (<0.3 mg/dL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 71 (0-15 mm/hr), and positive COVID-19 via repeated nasopharyngeal swab. D-dimer was elevated at 1.7 (0.0-0.49 mg/L) as was his interleukin-6 at 3.8 (<1.8 pg/mL). Ferritin was abnormally low at 7 (26-388 ng/mL) and iron studies suggested iron deficiency anemia with total iron of 21 (65-175 ug/dL) and percent saturation of 6% (10-55%).\nIn light of an intraluminal thrombus, the patient was initially treated with aspirin, statin, and heparin infusion without boluses. However, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin continued to slowly decline over the next three days to 6.9 g/dL, prompting transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells as well as intravenous iron. Upon further questioning, the patient admitted he had noted bright red blood when defecating with intermittent passage of clots confirmed by our healthcare team. He also revealed history of bleeding internal hemorrhoids since age 15 years, not previously reported, and occurring as recently as two to three weeks prior to his stroke. Heparin was discontinued and hemorrhoids were visualized on rectal exam. He was continued on 81 mg of aspirin daily.\nHypercoagulable workup including antinuclear antibodies, factor V Leiden, anticardiolipin, antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant, protein C and S activity, prothrombin G20210A mutation, and homocysteine were all within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiography did not identify any intracardiac defects. To clarify his risk of recurrent thrombosis against his bleeding risk, colonoscopy, transesophageal echocardiography, and cerebral catheter angiography were sought. However, despite any respiratory symptoms, our patient repeatedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR on day one, three, and six, deeming the risk of aerosolization too high for such invasive procedures. Antibody testing was pursued to further stratify infectivity which showed the patient had developed immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies. Nevertheless, our patient did not have these procedures done inpatient as utility surrounding antibody testing did not comment on infectivity.\nOur patient was ultimately discharged in stable condition after multiple studies excluded all other causes of thromboembolic large vessel stroke. Repeat CTA done three days after admission continued to show an intraluminal filling defect (Figure -Panel B). Another CTA was obtained twelve days after admission which demonstrated complete resolution of the left carotid thrombus, and without any evidence of new strokes or intracranial hemorrhage (Figure -Panel C). At the time of discharge, his hemoglobin had significantly improved following intravenous iron administration and his dimer value had decreased since admission, although remained slightly elevated. He was discharged with daily aspirin and statin for secondary stroke prevention, as well as counseling regarding diet and exercise. At one month after discharge, he had completely recovered without recurrent transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n99.0", "task": "calc"}

At the time of discharge on POD 4, his creatinine was 125.53 \u03bcmol/L (1.42 mg/dL). On POD 8, a biopsy performed because of a creatinine increase showed Banff Ia cellular rejection, which was treated successfully with three pulses of methylprednisolone. On POD 13, a control biopsy showed mesangiolysis and double contours (). C4d staining was negative, there was no sign of glomerulitis or capillaritis, and detection of anti-HLA antibodies by Luminex was negative. Associated causes were ruled out, and it was suspected that the TMA was drug-related. At the time of the TMA diagnosis, no DSA was detected, and laboratory test values were as follows: creatinine 178.57 \u03bcmol/L (2.02 mg/dL), platelet count 218000/mm3, tacrolimus trough level 6.9 ng/dL hemoglobin 88 g/L, LDH 230 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.20 \u03bcmol/L, and haptoglobin 1.06 g/L, and no schistocytes were found. Tacrolimus treatment was suspended, and belatacept was initiated at 10 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 14, 28, 60, and 90; maintenance treatment was 5 mg/kg once a month for 1 year. The creatinine level decreased. On POD 31, a control biopsy showed Banff IIa cellular rejection that was treated with ATG. Administration of belatacept continued as planned. On POD 40, a biopsy showed no sign of rejection or TMA; his creatinine level was 122.88 \u03bcmol/L (1.39 mg/dL).\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n64.109", "task": "calc"}

Although experienced an uneventful pregnancy and full-term normal delivery, he was found with motor retardation and marasmus after his birth. He then developed slower than his peers \u2013 cannot stand until the 18th month after birth and cannot walk until 2 years old. He experienced gradually aggravated limb weakness followed by unsteady movement from his childhood, he could not pass physical education lessons since primary school. Nine years ago (age of eight years), the patient experienced recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness (in the absence of seizure), presenting with dropping out things in hands. The time of duration was about 1 min while the seizure frequency was around 5\u20136 times per year. Five years ago (age of 12 years), his weakness aggravated, he had difficulty climbing stairs and carrying basin, together with myoclonic seizures in head, and slight clonic episodes in four extremities. This symptom occurred during both day and night time. He also suffered instability in holding chopsticks and bowls, walking in faltering steps, and feeling difficult to walk straight. Two years ago (age of 10 years), he appeared to have inarticulate speech. All the above symptoms aggravated progressively. There was no family history. Physical examination showed that his blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, his height was 165 cm, and weighing 40 kg, he had normal vision and hearing, but his thoracic spine was left bending. Neurological examination revealed slurred speech, other cranial nerve functions were all normal. He was found with muscle atrophy in four extremities; circumference of both proximal lower limbs on location that 10 cm up to the kneecaps was 31 cm and circumference of both distal lower limbs on location that 10 cm below to the kneecaps was 27.5 cm.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 20-year-old Nepalese male was admitted to our hospital after a 3-day history of a high fever and cough. He had been previously seen at another local clinic where he was diagnosed with influenza and treated with oral oseltamivir for the first 3 days. On the fourth day, he developed dyspnea and was admitted to our hospital on the same day. He did not have any relevant past history and had not been prescribed any medications. He came to Japan for employment almost five years ago with his parents and took his residence in Saitama Prefecture.\nHis vital signs on the day of admission were as follows: level of consciousness, E3V4M6/Glasgow Coma Scale; blood pressure, 100/72 mmHg; heart rate, 133 beats per minute; body temperature, 38.4 \u00b0C; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation level at an O2 flow rate of 2 liters per minute, 94%. Physical examination revealed lower respiratory sounds, and a few moist rales were heard in both lungs on chest auscultation. Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 700/mm3, a blood platelet count of 82,000/mm3, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 23.2 mg/dl, a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26.3 mg/dl, and a serum creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal except for a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 618 IU/l. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed infiltrative and nodular shadows with pneumatocele formation in the right upper lobe ().\nAt first, we diagnosed severe bacterial pneumonia after influenza and septic shock and initiated the administration of lactate Ringer\u2019s solution, noradrenalin infusion, and intravenous tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) (4.5 g, 4 times daily) and azithromycin (AZM) (500 mg, once a day). However, his vital signs did not improve, and he developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation support. After rapid deterioration of his arterial oxygenation level, we introduced veno-veno extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Because gram-positive staphylococci were detected from sputum and blood samples collected on admission, we added linezolid (600 mg, 2 times daily, intravenously) on day 2. On the same day, we performed a bronchoscopy, which showed diffuse inflammatory changes and easy bleeding (). Therefore, we suspected necrotizing pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA. He underwent multidisciplinary treatment; however, his respiratory condition gradually worsened. Despite resuscitation efforts, he died of multiple organ failure on day 7. The isolates from the culture of blood and sputum samples on the day of hospital admission were MRSA strains TUM18988 and TUM18989.

Two days before admission, she developed watery diarrhoea and repeated vomiting.\nHer perinatal history was complicated by premature birth (34th week) with weight 2200 g, Apgar scale \u221210. Her motor development was delayed in the first 2 years of life.\nAt admission, the girl complained about moderate abdominal pain and watery stools.\nPhysical examination showed a body temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, pulse rate of 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg. The abdomen was soft, but painful. The bowel sounds were increased. Neurologic examination showed normal condition without pathological reflexes.\nLaboratory findings presented the following: leukocyte count 4800/\u03bcL, erythrocyte count 4,920,000/\u03bc, platelet count 253,000/\u03bcL, haemoglobin 13.3 g/dL and glucose 77 mg/dL. The serum electrolyte levels were as follows: sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 4.89 mmol/L, calcium 2.49 mmol/L and magnesium 19.3 mmol/L. Aspartate aminotransferase was 49 U/L and alanine aminotransferase 26 U/L. C-reactive protein was elevated to 2.57 mg/dL. Serum samples showed an absence of antibodies against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex 1 and 2 viruses, Borrelia burgdorferi and Toxoplasma gondii. Lumbar puncture was not performed; cerebrospinal fluid could not be analysed for this patient.\nEnzyme immunoassay detection of Rotavirus in the stool was positive. The stool culture and Adenovirus antigen were negative.\nOn the day of admission, the girl presented six episodes of generalized tonic seizures with lockjaw and flexion of the extremities. The first two episodes lasted up to 1 min and subsided after diazepam. The subsequent ones were shorter and disappeared spontaneously. Between these episodes, the patient\u2019s consciousness was disturbed. During further hospitalization, no seizures were observed.\nBrain magnetic resonance imagination (MRI) was performed on the third day after admission using a 3-T scanner (MAGNETOM Spectra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). T1-weighted examination was performed before and after i.v. administration of gadobutrol (Bayer Vital, Leverkusen, Germany, 0.1 mmol/kg body weight). The imaging showed the hyperintense region in T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) MRI, a well-defined lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum with restricted diffusion in diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and no enhancement in post contrast T1-weighted (Fig. ).\nAn electroencephalogram EEG was performed with a 42-channel DigiTrack system (Elmiko, PL), with electrodes placed in compliance with the international 20-electrode system. Her first EEG (the third day) showed slowed brain activity in the posterior occipitotemporal portion, consisting mainly of theta waves with a frequency of 4.5\u20135.5 Hz and amplitude of 40 uV.\nShe was treated with intravenous crystalloids without anticonvulsant control. After the MRI results, dexamethasone therapy (0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was started.\nAn MRI performed 12 days after admission revealed no abnormal signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig. ). The EEG (awake and sleep) was completely normal.\nThe child was sent home without signs of neurological complications.
