She experienced menarche more than 2 years ago with a menstrual cycle of 18\u201321 days and menstruation lasting 6\u20137 days with normal menstrual flow. However, the menstruation ceased 7 months after menarche with no obvious cause. Her last menstruation was on June 26, 2017. Her past medical history revealed recurrent attacks of urticaria 6 years ago, which were attributed to allergies to abalone, milk, soy, and eggs. She was diagnosed as having Graves\u2019 disease 4 years ago. She was treated with thiamazole, which was discontinued after more than 2 years of treatment and her thyroid function returned to normal with monitoring. Her personal history revealed that she had a full-term birth and a birth weight of 2.85 kg. The developmental milestones of raising her head, turning over, sitting up, crawling, and walking were achieved at normal times, and her academic performance was good. Her mother was 42-years old and had regular menstruation; our patient\u2019s maternal grandmother experienced menopause at the age of 50.\nA physical examination revealed: a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C; pulse, 63 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; blood pressure, 93/60 mmHg; height, 161.5 cm; body weight, 47 kg; upper body height 80.5 cm; lower body height 81 cm; and arm span 161.5 cm. The appearance of her vulva was normal, with Tanner II breast development and Tanner I pubic hair development. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations revealed no abnormalities, and there were no malformations such as webbed neck, cubitus valgus, or shortened metacarpals. Supplemental examination results of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, sex hormones, and thyroid hormones are shown in Tables , and . The results of blood, urine, and fecal tests were normal; the results of electrolytes test, liver function test, and kidney function test were normal. Ultrasound examinations of her breasts, thyroid, and abdomen revealed no abnormalities. Her lumbar spine bone density T-score was \u2212 1.5. Her growth hormone level at 1 hour of deep sleep was 2.19 ng/mL (reference range, 0.123\u20138.05) and parathyroid hormone level was 30.5 pg/mL (reference range, 15\u201368.3). Her anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone level was < 0.06 ng/mL (reference range, 2.80\u20136.3). Serum anti-ovarian antibody, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and extractable nuclear antigens polypeptide titers were negative. A transrectal color Doppler ultrasound revealed the size of her uterus to be 19 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 22 mm, with a small volume and an intimal thickness of approximately 3 mm. The sizes of her left and right ovaries were 16 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 8 mm and 18 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 mm, respectively, indicating that both ovaries were small. A 3.7 \u00d7 3.3 mm sized follicle was visible in her left ovary. Magnetic resonance imaging of her pituitary gland indicated no abnormalities. Her bone age was approximately 15\u201316 years. Her chromosomal type was 46,XX as per the karyotype analysis of 50 cells. Whole-exome genetic testing did not reveal mutations associated with amenorrhea. Gene copy number testing revealed no obvious pathological copy number variation (CNV).\nAfter learning about the disease, our patient suffered from anxiety and insomnia. Psychologists counselled and reassured her that treatment could lead to improvement. Estazolam was prescribed as a sleep aid for a short period, together with 0.5 mg estradiol once daily, calcium, and vitamin D replacement. Follow-up and ultrasound re-examination after 6 months of treatment revealed that her uterus had increased in size to 24 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 25 mm. There was no significant change in the bilateral ovarian size, and no follicles were found. Further examination showed Tanner III breast development and Tanner I pubic hair.

He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. He reported having a severe toothache for last two days in the mandibular anterior region and difficulty with normal eating, brushing, and speaking.\nAn extraoral examination revealed no facial abnormality. His temperature was 38.0\u00b0C. His blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, and pulse was 75 beats/minute. Bilaterally, in the submandibular region, a few enlarged and tender lymph nodes were palpable.\nAn examination was performed intraorally that confirmed the presence of severe pain, tissue swelling, and bleeding from the gingiva.\nA heavy accumulation of dental plaque and calculus was noticed (Figure ). Gingival recession on the lingual side was noted for the mandibular left central incisor. Periodontal pocket depths were normal (in the range of 3-4 mm) in rest of the dentition.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe patient is a 63-year-old Caucasian man. He is 1.61 meters tall and weighs 66 kilograms. After working as a car mechanic for 36 years, he had been receiving disability benefits for 11 years. He was working part-time as a caretaker averaging 10 hours per week until two and a half years ago. At the age of 35, the patient began having bouts of severe back pain approximately twice a year. When these episodes occurred, he took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for three to four weeks for pain relief. At the age of 40, lumbar spondylolisthesis was diagnosed by radiography. At the age of 50, he suddenly developed severe right hip pain. He suffered from substantial arthrosis on the right side, which was treated with a total hip replacement one year later.\nThree years ago, he began to develop neurological symptoms in both hands. Pain and loss of function of his fingers prevented him from working as a caretaker. The pain radiated from his neck bilaterally down to his fingers and was described as parasthesia-like in nature. He also complained of weakness in his hands. Left hand digit flexion was classified as J1 and right hand as J4. Digit extension was classified as J4 on the left and J2 on the right and abduction on the left was classified as J0 and on the right as J1. The patient also had difficulty walking (Nurick 4, EMS 10/18) as he had to support himself using his surroundings in order to stand upright and was unable to walk unassisted. He was referred to a neurologist by his general practitioner who in turn referred him to a neurosurgeon. Radiographs (Figure ) magnetic resonance imaging (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a spondylolisthesis between C7 and T1. Using the Meyerding classification [], which was initially developed for grading the degree of lumbar spondylolisthesis, the patient would have been diagnosed with a cervico-thoracic spondylolisthesis of the second or third degree. The spondylolisthesis, measured using the method developed by Kawasaki et al. [], was 13 mm. In view of the special nature of the case, a collaborative treatment between neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons was favored and subsequently implemented.\nThe surgical management was performed as follows:\nThe patient was placed in the supine position. The intervertebral disk at C7-T1 was exposed using blunt dissection. The disk was then removed to the point of the ligamentum flavum. A subsequent resection of the lateral parts of the intervertebral discs significantly mobilized the spondylolisthesis.\nThe wound was closed and the patient was rotated to the prone position. First, the dislocation between vertebras C7 and T1 was reduced while positioning the head.\nSubsequently, the lateral masses were prepared from a dorsal approach between C5 and T3. Then, lateral mass-screws were inserted into C5 and C6. We had noticed considerable laxity between C6 and C7. In addition, C5 and C6 were naturally fused and we decided to include them in the instrumentation. There was also a rigid displacement between C7 and T1.\nBicortical screws were then inserted into the transverse processes of T2 and T3. These were inserted into at least two segments from both sides in divergent directions. The length of these screws was 10 to 12 mm, with a diameter of 3.2 mm.\nThis was followed by a laminectomy. Since the roots of C7 and C8 were exposed, the lateral masses of C7 and C8 had to be resected. Longitudinal rods were placed. Proper reduction in lordosis and the preservation of a 5 mm intervertebral space between C7 and T1 were confirmed by radiograph. Set screws were used to fix the instrumentation in the desired position. Chips of cortical and cancellous bone were placed lateral to the longitudinal rods.\nThe dorsal wound was then closed. The patient was again rotated to the supine position to reopen the ventral wound. Now, instead of the previously seen displacement, a large gap was visible between C7 and T1. The endplates between C7 and T1 were milled and the ligamentum flavum was resected using punches. Then, the spinal canal was exposed completely, using a Caspar opener.\nSubsequently, a Harms basket, filled with autograft bone chips, was inserted into the intervertebral space. Three drains were placed and the wound was closed. For prophylactic infection control, the patient was perioperatively given intravenous 1.5 g cefuroxime twice a day for the next four days. Intraoperative and postoperative radiographs (Figure and ) were taken to confirm correct placement of the instrumentation.\nFollowing the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. His vital signs were stable enough for him to be transferred to the general postoperative recovery ward on the fourth postoperative day. Eleven days after surgery, the patient left the hospital and entered an orthopedic and neurologic rehabilitation program.\nThe pain and parasthesias in his fingers resolved after the operation. Two months postoperatively, his ability to walk had noticeably improved after completing his rehabilitation program (Nurick 3).\nToday, two years postoperatively, the patient is able to walk without assistance (Nurick 2). Flexion of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J3 and as J5 on the right hand. Extension of the fingers on his left hand was graded as J4 and as J2 on the right. Abduction was graded as J4 for his left hand and as J2 for his right hand (EMS 14/18).\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n61.073", "task": "calc"}

He was conscious, but he appeared to be pale. He did not have any positive history in terms of nausea, vomiting, cough, or dyspnea. However, he suffered from generalized muscle spasms and pain. There was not any positive finding during heart and lung examinations. His abdomen was nontender, but pitting edema (2+) was observed in the lower extremities. Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs were positive, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a prolonged QT interval (QT = 550 msec). Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19, lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed and the results were highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection ().\nIn the first hour of admission, intravenous infusion of 10% calcium gluconate was initiated promptly, and muscle spasms disappeared within four hours.

Cardiac catheterization showed a 90% stenosis at each branch of left and right coronary arteries. The patient responded to medical therapy; thus, elective on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was scheduled.\nHe had a history of deep vein thrombosis and multiple cerebral infarctions at 46 years of age. Screening for a thrombophilic diathesis was performed at that time and showed a reduced PS activity level of 33.7% (reference range, 70\u2013160%), while the PC activity level was normal at 123% (reference range, 70\u2013130%). The significant difference between the PS and PC activity levels strongly suggested PS deficiency. He had no comorbidities to which acquired PS deficiency could be attributed; therefore, the hereditary form was suspected.\nAfter admission, an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% and abnormal wall motion with mild aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. His hemoglobin concentration was 11.3 g/dL, platelet count was 170,000/mm3, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was 2.54, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 43.6 s (control, 30 s). Warfarin was stopped 7 days before surgery, and the patient was started on intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain an aPTT of 45 to 75 s (1.5\u20132.5 times control). Heparin was stopped 5 h before surgery. After anesthetic induction, the activated clotting time (ACT) was 142 s.\nThe patient received 720 mL of FFP prior to heparinization. Its volume was determined by taking the patient\u2019s urine output into consideration to avoid heart congestion. Before the initiation of CPB, 300 units/kg of heparin was administered and the ACT was 536 s. The left and right internal thoracic arteries were grafted to the left posterolateral branch and the left anterior descending artery, respectively. The total CPB time was 138 min with an aortic cross-clamp time of 102 min, and the patient was weaned from bypass without complications. After a protamine dose of 3 mg/kg, the ACT was 126 s, while the bilateral internal thoracic artery graft flow was maintained at > 50 mL/min. An additional 1200 mL of FFP was transfused after protamine administration until the end of surgery. Its volume was decided, considering the CPB ultrafiltration volume. The amount of bleeding was 1200 mL and total intraoperative transfusion comprised 2240 mL of packed red blood cells, 1920 mL of FFP, and 200 mL of packed platelets.\nIn the intensive care unit, an additional 360 mL of FFP was administered. Nineteen hours postoperatively, the patient had no bleeding, and the heparin infusion was resumed with a dose adjustment to achieve an aPTT of 45 to 75 s. Warfarin was restarted 3 days after the surgery and adjusted to maintain a PT-INR of 1.5 to 2.5. The heparin infusion was discontinued after the PT-INR became stable.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 69-year-old male (height 160 cm, weight 56 kg) was diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma in the right upper lobe (RUL) and scheduled for a right upper lobectomy under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Preoperatively, the patient had no findings suggesting a difficult airway. The Mallampati grade was Class II, with normal mouth opening, neck extension, and thyromental distance. The chest X-ray and computed tomography showed no anatomical abnormalities in the trachea or mainstem bronchi. The internal diameter of the left mainstem bronchus was 12.5 mm; thus, a 37 Fr left-sided DLT was selected for lung separation.\nThe patient arrived at the operating room without premedication. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced by the target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil, starting at effect site concentrations of 4 \u00b5g/ml and 4 ng/ml, respectively. After loss of consciousness, manual bagmask ventilation was achieved without difficulty, and 50 mg rocuronium were administered for neuromuscular blockade. After 3 min, we attempted endotracheal intubation with a 37 Fr left-sided DLT using a Macintosh no.4 laryngoscope blade. However, unexpectedly, the direct laryngoscopic view showed Cormack-Lehane grade IIIb, even though he had no physical attributes that predicted difficult intubation during the preoperative airway evaluation. The epiglottis was only just visible, and additional manipulations, such as pressing the cricoid cartilage or jaw thrust by two assistants, did not improve the direct laryngoscopic glottic view. Although we tried to insert the DLT into the glottis under the epiglottis without obtaining sufficient glottic exposure, intubation failed. Fortunately, however, manual ventilation was adequate, and the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was maintained at 100% between intubation attempts.\nInstead of a DLT, we decided to use a SLT to secure the airway and a BB to achieve lung separation. A tracheoscopic ventilation tube (TVT; VivaSight\u2122-SL, ETView Ltd, Misgav, Israel) was selected to improve the poor glottic view (). A stylet was inserted into a TVT with a 7.5 mm internal diameter (10.5 mm external diameter), and the distal portion of the TVT was flexed in a hockey-stick shape. The TVT was connected to a monitoring device with a 5.4 \u00d7 7 cm screen. After direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh no.4 blade, the TVT was inserted into the oropharynx, and then full glottic opening was visible on the TVT monitor. Using the real-time image on the monitor, the TVT was inserted into the glottis. After removing the stylet, the TVT was positioned at the level of the mid-trachea. Then, a Coopdech BB (Daiken Medical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) was inserted through the TVT and placed in the right mainstem bronchus (RMB) under the view of the TVT monitor. The BB cuff was positioned just below the carina, so as not to obstruct the RUL bronchus (). The BB position was monitored continuously while changing the patient's position and then readjusted after the patient was in the left lateral decubitus position. Complete collapse of the right lung was verified by the thoracoscopic view, and OLV was performed with a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The respiratory rate and inspired oxygen fraction were adjusted to obtain arterial tensions of 40-45 mmHg for CO2 and > 100 mmHg for oxygen.\nThe surgery proceeded uneventfully before the bronchial resection. After dissecting the RUL bronchus, it was transected using a surgical stapler (Endo GIA\u2122, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). However, when checking the transected bronchial stump, the surgeon found that the distal tip of the BB had been included in the staple line (). Since the BB tip was firmly trapped in the staple line, the BB could not be withdrawn manually. Therefore, the surgeon removed some staples from the bronchial stump to free the BB tip, and then the BB was withdrawn carefully and left in the trachea considering the risk of its reinsertion into the RUL bronchus. For right lung collapse, thus, the surgeon manually sutured the partially opened stump under apnea without conversion to open thoractomy. The repair took about 2 min, and the oxygen saturation remained above 95% during apnea. The separated distal tip of the BB was found in the staple line of the RUL surgical specimen (). No endobronchial defect was seen in the sutured line on bronchoscopic evaluation, and no significant air leak was detected during a leakage test of the operative lung at a positive pressure of 25 cmH2O. A chest tube was inserted to check postoperative bleeding and air leakage.\nThe operation was finished without any other adverse events, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close observation. No air leakage was found through the chest tube. A bronchoscopic evaluation was done on the 2nd postoperative day and there were no problems in the repaired lesion. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day without complications.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n56.529", "task": "calc"}

A urine drug screen was negative, and serum ethanol level was undetectable.\nThe patient was diagnosed with euglycemic DKA precipitated by an underlying infection. Intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation with normal saline was initially started at a rate of 1.0 L/h for a total of 2 L. The patient's hydration status, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and urine output were monitored closely. After 2 h, repeat blood work showed a serum sodium 141 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 8 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, and glucose 153 mg/dL. Subsequently, IVFs were switched to 5% dextrose and 0.45% NaCl at a rate of 250 cc/h, and an insulin drip at a rate of 5 units/h was started. Then, 30 mEq potassium was added to each liter of the IVF, excluding the first liter, targeting a serum potassium level of 4-5 mEq/L. After 11 h, blood work revealed a serum bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L with a normal anion gap; hence, subcutaneous insulin and oral intake were initiated. Intravenous insulin was continued for another hour to ensure adequate plasma insulin levels.

He had ingested about 50 mL of fertilizer 2 days prior to admission. On presentation, he complained of a sore throat and epigastric pain. The patient had a medical history of unmedicated chronic hepatitis B and had worked in a car-manufacturing factory for 10 years. He had a 20 pack-year smoking history. On admission, his blood pressure was 130/78 mmHg, pulse rate was 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. He had mild painful oral erosion and his lungs sounded clear to auscultation. Laboratory results from another hospital immediately after the ingestion had revealed the following findings: serum creatinine (Cr), 1.1 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count, 113,600 cells/\u03bcL; the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) results were as follows: pH, 7.340; PCO2, 40.3 mmHg; PO2, 96.8 mmHg; HCO3, 21.2 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 96.8% on room air. On admission to our hospital, laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 16.3 g/dL; WBC count, 23,290 cells/\u03bcL; platelet count, 167,000 cells/\u03bcL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 48 mg/dL; serum Cr, 5.06 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 1.7 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 43 U/L; and glucose, 140 mg/dL. ABGA results were as follows: pH, 7.415; PCO2, 36.6 mmHg; PO2, 73 mmHg; HCO3, 25.5 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 95% on room air. Urinary analysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ protein, 2+ glucose, trace occult blood, and no WBCs, with proteinuria at 550 mg/day. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers were below 1 : 40 (nuclear pattern) and results for other serologic markers were nonspecific. Abdominal sonography revealed increased kidney size with increased parenchymal echogenicity.\nDespite continuous fluid therapy, the patient's levels of BUN and Cr increased gradually, and thus renal biopsy was performed on day 3 of admission. The kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis without infiltration of inflammatory cells. Although the histologic findings were not diffuse, definite features of tubular damage were noted. Necrotic sloughing of tubular cells was found, with mitotic figures present in regenerating tubular cells. Necrotic cellular casts were also noted in the tubular lumina (). Ultrastructural examination revealed electron-dense deposits in subendothelium of glomerular capillaries. And focal effacement and fusion of foot processes of podocytes were noted (). Tubular cells contained electron-dense lysosomes in the cytoplasm and lumina ().\nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed on day 4: arterial PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg. Corticosteroid therapy for acute lung injury was administered for 28 days, beginning on day 5 (1 mg/kg/day of intravenous methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper). Hemodialysis was provided 5 times from day 5 to day 10 for the treatment of hyperkalemia and oliguria. After the termination of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function recovered completely. During the administration of corticosteroid therapy, pulmonary fibrosis was observed on chest computed tomography. On day 16, bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema occurred. Although bilateral closed tube thoracotomy and a lung protective ventilation strategy were applied, the pneumothorax and pulmonary fibrosis progressed gradually.

She had a history of hypertension diagnosed at age 58 on treatment with angiotensin II receptor blocker. At time of her initial evaluation (at an outside facility) her serum creatinine was 1.1\u20131.2 mg/dL and urine analysis demonstrated proteinuria +++. She underwent a kidney biopsy that showed a FSGS lesion and presence of focal myelin figures within podocytes (zebra bodies). GLA sequencing for FD was negative. She had no history of prior exposure to silica, amiodarone or hydroxychloroquine, which can be associated with lesions resembling zebra bodies on EM. Her mother was diagnosed with FSGS at age 69 years, then developed end-stage renal disease, 2 years later, and was on dialysis until her 80s when she died. The patient\u2019s father had died due to liver cancer. She has two healthy brothers, ages 56 and 63, and two healthy sons who are 39 and 40 years old.\nDue to the inconsistency between the EM findings and the genetic analysis, and to obtain further clarification regarding the diagnosis, the patient was referred to Mayo Clinic 4 years after the first evaluation. She had no history of acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, transient ischemic attacks, hypohidrosis, parapelvic cysts or any other FD-related signs or symptoms []. One son had negative biochemical testing and the other had negative genetic testing for FD. Physical examination was unremarkable including no evidence of corneal abnormalities in ophthalmological evaluation. Laboratory evaluation is presented on Table . Cardiac and brain magnetic resonance imaging were unrevealing. To further evaluate the cause of her renal disease, she underwent a repeat kidney biopsy. On light microscopy (LM) there were 30% globally sclerotic glomeruli and one glomerulus showed segmental sclerosis with podocyte capping. Few glomeruli showed duplication of the glomerular basement membranes. There was mild tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (Fig. a) involving 25% of the cortex sampled accompanied by mild chronic interstitial inflammation. Some podocytes with bubbly cytoplasm were seen on LM (Fig. b). No glomeruli were seen in the immunofluorescence. There was 3+ focal tubular casts staining for IgA, kappa, and lambda with 2+ IgM. The medullary tissue was negative for IgG, C1q, C3, albumin, and fibrinogen. On EM, several podocytes contained myeline figures resembling zebra bodies (Fig. c and d) with podocytes displaying mild to moderate foot process effacement involving approximately 30% of the total peripheral capillary surface area. No myelin figures were seen within endothelial cells, mesangial cells, peritubular capillaries, or tubular cells. No beaded collagen fibrils were seen within the glomerular basement membranes. GLA deletion/duplication testing for FD gene was repeated and was negative. Due to the inconclusive biochemical and genetic testing, she was referred to the Department of Clinical Genomics for further evaluation. To further evaluate the cause of her renal biopsy findings, RNA sequencing of kidney tissue was performed through a research program in the Center for Individualized Medicine []. No variants, aberrant expression, aberrant splicing changes, or allelic imbalance was detected within GLA by RNA analysis. Moreover, there was no sign of skewed X chromosome expression. To search for other possible genetic explanation for her symptoms, whole exome sequencing was performed on the kidney tissue and revealed a pathogenic variant in LMX1B (NM_002316.3:c.737G > A, p.Arg246Gln), which is associated with NPLRD in multiple families. The variant was Sanger confirmed to be germline on DNA extracted from the patient\u2019s blood.

A male neonate, weighing 2.650 g, was delivered by elective C-section at 36 weeks\u2019 gestation. Immediately after birth, he developed a mild pneumothorax with respiratory distress requiring nasal CPAP. Initial serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dl. An initial attempt at transurethral catheterization using a 6 Fr Foley catheter was unsuccessful due to excessive resistance felt halfway through the urethra, and was followed by a self-limiting urethral bleeding. A 5 Fr umbilical catheter was therefore used to drain the bladder. Postnatal ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged and thick-walled bladder, associated with mild bilateral hydronephrosis, a dysplastic right kidney, and multiple small cysts with cortical subcapsular distribution in the contralateral left kidney. The umbilical catheter slipped out of the bladder after 72 h and was eventually replaced with a 6 Fr Foley catheter. On day-of-life 14, he was deemed fit enough to undergo VCUG. The test revealed a trabeculated bladder associated with a moderate posterior urethral dilatation and left-sided grade III vesicoureteral reflux. After catheter withdrawal, a good urinary stream and complete bladder emptying were documented during micturition (). The baby was ultimately discharge home on day-of-life 17, with a relatively stable renal function. Repeat VCUG at 9 months disclosed a less irregular bladder contour, gradual shrinking of the posterior urethral dilatation, and reflux disappearance. The bladder emptied rapidly, and postvoid residual urine volume was small. He is now 2 years old and, following a first episode of urinary tract infection, had undergone second look cystoscopy that ruled out obstructing residual valves. Follow-up ultrasonography showed progressive thinning of the bladder wall and minimal postvoid residual urine volume ().\nRenal function remains stable with a serum creatinine of 0.53 mg/dl.

With slight cord traction, complete inversion of the uterus, through the uterine incision occurred with the placenta remaining firmly attached to the uterine fundus (Fig. ). The inverted uterus was exteriorized at once and the placenta was manually removed. Several attempts for uterine reversion were done unsuccessfully for less than five minutes. Eventually, sevoflurane anesthesia was deepened from 1% to 5% and reversion of the uterus was finally achieved by gradually rolling the lowermost part of the posterior edge over the uterine fundus, thereby reverting that part that inverted last. The uterus was repositioned intraabdominally and an infusion of 20 i.u oxytocin plus 0.2 mg methylergometrine in 1000 ml Ringer's Lactated set maintained the uterine contractions.

The medical history revealed hypertension, but no history of trauma and radiation exposure or a family history of genetic diseases. Physical examination showed a large, hard, immobile mass with a smooth surface, ~6\u00d76 cm in size. Laboratory tests revealed a small increase in the serum creatinine level to 120 \u03bcmol/l (normal range, 40\u2013110 \u03bcmol/l), while the remaining results, including that for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were normal. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan () showed a large, dense mass, with calcification, located below the right kidney, an oppressed upper ureter and thickening of the renal fascia. An exploratory laparotomy discovered a stiff calcified immobile retroperitoneal mass of 5\u00d76 cm, with a wide base below the right kidney. The mass could not be completely resected of its attachment to the surrounding organs. Pathology revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle- and polygonal-shaped tumor cells, with a banded or irregular osteoid matrix. The tumor cells exhibited varying degrees of atypia and visible mitotic figures (). From these results, a diagnosis of extraskeletal osteosarcoma was formed. Immunohistochemistry showed the positive expression of vimentin and S-100, whereas examination of cytokeratin, cluster of differentiation (CD)117, CD34, epithelial membrane antigen, melanoma, B-cell lymphoma-2 and CD99 staining was negative.\nTwo months after the surgery, CT imaging () revealed a retroperitoneal ESOS near the right upper ureter, with a large amount of calcification. The imaging also revealed multiple metastases of the hepatic capsular, renal fascia and peritoneum. After four months, the patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy due to tumor relapse. The surgery demonstrated that the retroperitoneal mass of ~10\u00d710 cm in size was closely adhered to the right kidney, ileocecum and the posterior abdominal wall. There was significant chondroid tissue present on the omental tumors, which were 0.5\u00d71.5 cm in size. Only the omental metastases were cut, and cytoreductive surgery was not viable due to the multiple metastases of the abdominal cavity and the severe adhesion with the retroperitoneal tissue. Pathological examination showed that the tumor tissue was predominantly composed of spindle-shaped cells and differentiated immature bone tissue. The cells showed mild-moderate atypia and were ordered in a storiform arrangement, with visible mitotic figures. From these results, a diagnosis of an omental osteosarcoma was formed.\nThe patient was administered two courses of chemotherapy, where each cycle lasted 28 days. During each cycle Endostar (15 mg/day for the first 14 days), cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on the first day) and epirubicin (25 mg/m2 for the first three days) were administered intravenously, but this had minimal efficacy. Five months after the second surgery, the patient experienced vomiting and an incomplete intestinal obstruction was suspected. The patient therefore underwent a third exploratory laparotomy. The surgery revealed a 25\u00d730-cm right retroperitoneal mass oppressing the descending section of the duodenum and surrounded the descending colon, and a 1.1\u00d71.2-cm implantation metastasis nodule in the outer membrane of the gastric body anterior wall (). The liver and spleen exhibited no metastatic nodules. A gastrojejunostomy and ileocolonic anastomosis were performed, and the pathology () revealed components of an osteosarcoma in the outer stomach wall, in accordance with a gastric wall osteosarcoma metastasis.
