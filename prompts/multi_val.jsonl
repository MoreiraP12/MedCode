{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 70-year old female with cigarette smoking history of 50 pack years, presented with chronic cough and weight loss. CT scan of chest demonstrated a 4.7-cm right lower lobe lung mass. She was subsequently diagnosed with Stage Ib adenocarcinoma of lung and received right lung resection. Eighteen months later she developed recurrent disease in the lung and was treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Afterwards, she progressed with metastatic subcarinal, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. PET-CT and MRI of brain did not reveal extra-thoracic metastasis. Patient underwent biopsy of the mediastinal mass, which confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma. There was no mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor gene, or translocation in anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene in her tumor. She progressed through several lines of treatment including paclitaxel plus carboplatin then vinorelbine alone. Thereafter she was referred to medical oncology clinic of our cancer center, and nivolumab treatment was recommended.\nFour days after her first dose of nivolumab, patient presented with acute shortness of breath and chest pain. Initial work up, including infectious, was unremarkable except for mildly elevated creatinine kinase of 40 mg/dl. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with heart rate of 124 beats/min, blood pressure was 98/55 mm Hg and patient was afebrile. A CT angiography of chest showed no pulmonary embolism or pneumonitis but new-onset large pericardial effusion of 2.4 cm thickness (Fig. ). Patient was admitted to cardiology service, transthoracic echo confirmed large pericardial effusion; posteriorly 2.1 cm, anteriorly 1.6 cm without features of tamponade. Patient was started on colchicine and fluid resuscitation for her hypotension, with symptomatic improvement. Follow-up echocardiogram showed persistent pericardial effusion. Given unclear etiology of her pericardial effusion and likely immune-related adverse event (irAE) of nivolumab, patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. She continued to receive nivolumab treatment every 2 weeks. Follow up echocardiogram and computed tomographic scan (Fig. ) after 4 weeks showed complete resolution of pericardial effusion and her prednisone was slowly tapered off. One week after her prednisone was discontinued, she presented again with sub-sternal chest discomfort, shortness of breath and bilateral ankle edema. Echocardiogram showed recurrence of moderate to large pericardial effusion measuring 2.8 cm posteriorly and 1.2 cm anteriorly without tamponade. She was hospitalized for observation of any hemodynamic instability. Her recurrent pericardial effusion was likely irAE from nivolumab, hence nivolumab treatment was stopped and patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Significant clinical improvements was noted and follow up echocardiogram after 3 weeks showed complete resolution of her pericardial effusion. Nivolumab was resumed 1 week after while maintaining patient on low dose prednisone. Patient tolerated nivolumab well and a follow up echocardiogram 4 weeks later did not show any recurrence of pericardial effusion. The timeline of nivolumab treatment related to the development of pericardial effusion and the use of steroid is depicted in Fig. .\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n4.0", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 58-year-old Japanese man with an 8-year history of T2DM had a symptom of pain in his right lower leg and visited the emergency room in Kawasaki Medical School. Previously, he had felt the same pain in the same region when his blood glucose was very high and thereby he was diagnosed as having T2DM 8 years before.\nHe had acute osteomyelitis in his right lower leg when he was a baby. Except for this, he had no past history. He had no remarkable family history. He was a barber; he smoked tobacco (pack-years = 0.75 pack/day \u00d7 40 years) and he drank alcohol every day. After the episode of acute osteomyelitis when he was a baby, there was no problem in his legs until he had general fatigue and felt pain in his right lower leg at the age of 50. He visited the emergency room. His vital signs were as follows: heart rate 76 beats/minute, blood pressure 116/70 mmHg, and body temperature 36.4 \u00b0C. He had a symptom of slight local swelling and heat sensation in the same area with pain in his right lower leg, but there were no findings in physical and neurological examinations. In addition, there was no ulcer or injury on his skin surface. Laboratory data (Table ) were as follows: white blood cell count, 7400/\u03bcL (neutrophil 64.7%); C-reactive protein (CRP), 2.50 mg/dl; plasma glucose, 382 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 11.7%. He was diagnosed as having T2DM, but he had no diabetic complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lower limbs showed an abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg (Fig. ). An axial T1-weighted (T1W) image of his right lower leg showed a slightly lower intensity, and an axial T2-weighted (T2W) image showed a markedly higher intensity (Fig. , upper panels). Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic osteomyelitis and T2DM. We thought that it would be better to hospitalize him and start administering antibiotics via a drip, but he did not agree to the hospitalization. Therefore, as an alternative, we started 300 mg/day of cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate and insulin therapy (18 units of aspart) on an out-patient basis. After starting insulin therapy, his blood glucose level gradually decreased, and his leg pain was also gradually mitigated. Finally, his leg pain disappeared 2 weeks later. His CRP became within normal range, and 3 months later the focus in his right lower leg was markedly reduced on MRI. In addition, the focus was not detected in ultrasonography of the right tibia site. Just in case, however, we continued antibiotics therapy for 4 months. Since his glycemic control was improved 2 months later, we stopped insulin therapy and started orally administered anti-diabetic drugs.\nHe was then followed up as an out-patient with T2DM for approximately 8 years. The medication at that time was 1000 mg/day of metformin, 25 mg/day of alogliptin, 15 mg/day of pioglitazone, and 50 mg/day of ipragliflozin. However, he did not take the medicine for approximately 8 months on his own judgement at the age of 58. After his interruption of therapy for 8 months, he felt the same pain in the same right lower leg again. He immediately visited our hospital. He had symptoms of slight local swelling and heat sensation together with pain in the same area in his right lower leg, but again there were no findings in physical and neurological examinations at this time. His vital signs were as follows: heart rate 99 beats/minute, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, and body temperature 37.0 \u00b0C. He had a symptom of slight local swelling and heat sensation in the same area with pain in his right lower leg, but there was no ulcer or injury on his skin surface. Laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 6680/\u03bcL (neutrophil 63.4%); CRP, 0.32 mg/dl; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 31 mm/hour; plasma glucose, 652 mg/dL; HbA1c, 6.9%; glycoalbumin 46.1%. Other laboratory data were as follows: red blood cell, 476 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; hemoglobin (Hb), 15.9 g/dL; platelet, 25.1/\u03bcL; total protein (TP), 7.6 g/dL; albumin (Alb), 4.4 g/dL. Liver and renal function were within normal range as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 39 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 50 U/L; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP), 51 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 172 U/L; creatinine (Cre), 0.54 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 13 mg/dL; Na, 131 mEq/L; K, 4.4 mEq/L; Cl, 96 mEq/L. Pathogenic bacteria were not detected. He had no diabetic complications, probably because his glycemic control was relatively good before the interruption of therapy. His leg MRI showed a spreading of the abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg (Fig. , lower panels). We hospitalized him in our institution but he did not agree to undergo surgery for remission. Therefore, we started 3.0 g/day of sulbactam sodium/ampicillin sodium and insulin therapy (24 units of aspart and 20 units of glargine). After starting insulin therapy, his blood glucose level gradually decreased, and his leg pain was also gradually mitigated. Local swelling and heat sensation disappeared approximately 5 days later. Finally, his leg pain disappeared approximately 2 weeks later, and he was discharged from our hospital. Just in case, however, we continued antibiotics therapy (450 mg/day of rifampicin and 4 g/day of trimethoprim) for approximately 2 months. After a total of 3-month antibiotics therapy during hospitalization and after discharge, we stopped antibiotics therapy. He was then followed up for approximately 6 months, and his leg MRI showed a reduction of the abscess and inflammatory change in his right lower leg. He had no symptoms and/or problems, and his inflammation markers remained within normal levels for at least 6 months.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n90.0", "task": "calc"}

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Hormonal assays revealed cortisol <1.0ug/dL (normal range: 6 to 24), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) > 1250pg/mL (normal range: 20 to 100), a peak cortisol level below 0.2mcg/dL after intravenous ACTH stimulation test (250mcg). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.11uIU/mL (normal range: 0.4 to 5.0). Anti-thyroglobulin (Tg autoantibodies) were 217.8IU/mL (normal: <120), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO autoantibodies) 5176IU/mL (normal 60), and free thyroxine 1.4ng/dL (normal range: 0.7 to 2.0). The serum luteinizing hormone was 0.1mIU/ml (normal range: 2.9 to 21.7), follicle-stimulating hormone 0.2mIU/ml (normal range: 5 to 30), testosterone 0.02ng/mL (normal range: 9.0 to 40.0), prolactin 13ng/mL (normal range: 3 to 30). Insulin C-peptide was <0.50ng/mL (normal range: 1.5 to 3.5). Parathormone (PTH) was 33.4pg/mL (normal range: 2 to 72). Thyroid ultrasonography revealed heterogeneous echogenicity without any nodules, while ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. His immunogenetic study demonstrated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was HLA-DR3. Based on combinations of 1DM, subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, vililligo and HLA-DR3, a diagnosis of APS2 was made. The presence of positivity for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA with elevated ALT and AST levels even in the absence of hepatomegaly confirmed the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. His general condition improved gradually following the administration of hydrocortisone (10mg twice daily) and fludrocortisone (0.1mg twice daily). His diabetes was controlled with intensive multiple daily insulin injections. He was referred to the regional hepatology unit for further assessment including liver biopsy and consideration of hepatitis C eradication therapy but his father preferred to delay the treatment because he was worried about the side effects of the treatment.\n\nWhat is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n120.448", "task": "calc"}

Except penicillin allergy, she had no history of cardiovascular diseases, nor did she have any coronary risk factors, including smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coagulative disorder, oral contraceptive use, and/or family history of myocardial disease. Physical examination and routine preoperative laboratory tests, including chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were unremarkable with total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein within normal range.\nAfter arriving at the operating room, ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring were attached to the patient. For induction of general anesthesia, thiopental sodium 200 mg, followed by rocuronium 20 mg, were injected intravenously and classic laryngeal mask airway (No. 4) was inserted. Then, she was positioned to lithotomy for the operation. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 5.0-6.0 vol% in 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen. The operation was uneventful for 30 minutes, with stable vital signs, except slight tachycardia with heart rate 105 to 120 beats/min. Further, the estimated blood loss was negligible.\nAt the end of the surgery, ergonovine maleate 0.2 mg distilled with normal saline 10 ml was intravenously administered slowly for a minute at the request of the surgeon for the uterine contraction. About 2 minutes later, EtCO2 suddenly decreased to 20 mmHg from 33 mmHg, followed by a loss of plethysmographic wave. The patient was cyanotic, but anesthetic monitor showed no noticeable change in the airway pressure and expiratory tidal volume. The blood pressure, although measured at 119/89 mmHg a few minutes ago, was not checkable with un-palpable radial pulse, and ECG showed severe bradycardia, followed by asystole.\nImmediately, 1 mg epinephrine was injected intravenously, FiO2 increased to 100%, and thereafter, chest compression was started. Laryngeal mask airway was changed to endotracheal tube (No. 7), under direct laryngoscopy, right internal jugular vein cannulated and arterial line in the right radial artery established, while chest compression continued, inotropics infused and intermittent atropine and other drugs were administered. Even with these measures, the patient responded poorly and cardiac rhythm couldn't be detected. The patient was just showing low blood pressure of about 40/20 mmHg, which was observed via arterial line, probably due to chest compression. About 20 minutes after cardiac arrest, ECG returned to sinus rhythm but with tachycardia and ST elevation. Blood pressure increased to 60/20 mmHg, heart rate was at 130 beats/min, SpO2 85%, and arterial blood gas analysis with pH 7.2, PCO2 42.7 mmHg, PO2 54.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 18.2 mmol/L, base -8.2 mmol/L, and sO2 82%. Other hematologic and electrolyte were within normal limits and the results were as follows: Hemoglobin 12.2 g/dl, Hematocrit 39.7%, Na+ 136 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, Ca2+ 4.5 mg/dl, and Cl- 117 mg/dl. With continued intotropic support, nitroglycerin 100 \u00b5g was intravenously administered with the suspicion of myocardial ischemia. Within 5 minutes, blood pressure further increased to 123/80 mmHg, heart rate to 128 beats/min, SpO2 100%. However, afterwards, the systolic blood pressure decreased to 75 mmHg and SpO2 88% again, despite inotropic support.\nChest X-ray, taken immediately after arrival to the intensive care unit, showed bilateral diffuse pulmonary edema (). Even though ECG didn't show definite ST abnormalities, except sinus tachycardia (), cardiac enzymes were elevated as follows; troponin I 3.2 ng/ml (normal < 0.78), CK-MB 12.08 ng/ml (normal < 5). Transthoracic echocardiography showed the ejection fraction of only 22% (normal 56-78%), with severe hypokinesia in the inferior and septal area. Patient was unresponsive, blood pressure still low with systolic pressure below 80 mmHg and oxygen saturation around 75-82%. So, the patient was managed with the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Capiox SP Pump controller 101, Terumo, Japan) through left femoral veno-right femoral arterial route with initial blood flow of 2-2.5 L/min. After that, the hemodynamics and oxygenation became stable with blood pressure 100/47 mmHg, and SpO2 100%.\nShe regained consciousness at the night of the operative day, and endotracheal tube was removed the following day. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was weaned and inotrope infusion was stopped at the third postoperative day. Afterwards, she recovered and was discharged without cardiopulmonary complication.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

His initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 133/75 mmHg, pulse of 83 BPM, and temperature of 36.3\u00b0C. A physical exam revealed rebound tenderness and guarding. His initial labs were as follows: white blood cell count of 15.3 K/\u03bcL, hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 47.8%, platelet count of 376 K/\u03bcL, and a normal coagulation profile. The patient stated that the day prior to the flight, he had a solid bowel movement with no blood or melena noted and was not vomiting at that time; he also denied any sick contacts.\nAfter several hours in the Emergency Department, the patient attempted to stand and lost consciousness. An immediate blood pressure was noted to be 53 systolic. Repeat blood work was sent which revealed a decreasing hematocrit (48% to 30%) and hemoglobin (15.7 g/dL to 9.6 g/dL). Fluids were started and an emergent abdominal CT was performed. The CT scan revealed hyper-dense fluid present throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with heterogeneity of the fluid and an active contrast blush (). A surgical consult was called and the patient was taken to the operating room emergently for exploration.\nIn the operating room, Meckel's diverticulum was encountered with a mesodiverticular band that appeared to have torn, resulting in massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. A small bowel resection was performed to include Meckel's diverticulum, and continuity was reestablished with a side-side stapled enteric anastomosis. Total blood loss for the case was 2000 mL; 3 units of packed red blood cells and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma were administered.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nWe report the case of a 32-year-old Chinese patient who had a history of two pregnancy-related thromboembolic events. These events were cerebral vein-venous sinus thrombosis at 5 gestational weeks (GW) when she was 27 years old and left lower thrombosis following a miscarriage in her second pregnancy in the first trimester at 29 years old. At that point, she was then treated with warfarin.\nAfter routine assessments were performed in the patient at 32 years old, no inherited or acquired risk factors for thrombosis or related family history were discovered, except for AT activity. Her AT activity was only 37% (normal range: 75%\u2013125%) (Berichrom Antithrombin III; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) while the AT antigen (BN ProSpec system AT-III; Siemens) was 93% (normal range: 80%\u2013120%). The D-dimer concentration was 0.2 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units (normal range: 0\u20130.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units), platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid was 82% (normal range: 60%\u201380%), the prothrombin time was 13.5 s (normal range: 10.3\u201316.6 s), and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 32 s (normal range: 25.1\u201336.5 s). Her fibrinogen concentration was 1.13 \u00b5g/mL (normal range: 0\u20135 \u00b5g/mL), protein C activity was 98.8% (normal range: 70%\u2013140%), protein S activity was 93.8% (normal range: 63.5%\u2013149%), and homocysteine concentration was 9.8 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 3\u201317 \u00b5mol/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and beta-2 glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies, were negative.\nThe SERPINC1 gene in this patient was then analyzed by the gold standard Sanger fluorescent sequencing method in which all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter region were examined (ABI PRISM 3130; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation, which led to a tyrosine to cysteine change at amino acid position 95, compatible with a type II HBS defect (). On the basis of the findings of a low AT activity level, normal AT antigen level, and genetic result, we made the diagnosis of type II hereditary AT deficiency. Unfortunately, her parents were not available for laboratory assessment for AT activity and genetic testing.\nWhen the patient was 31 years old, she consulted her doctor because she wanted to become pregnant again. At the start of her pregnancy, thromboprophylaxis with self-injection of LMWH at 4100 units every 12 hours with FFP 1 unit weekly was prescribed to replace warfarin because of its adverse effects on the fetus. She had arachidonic acid and D-dimer concentrations measured fortnightly, while her AT activity and anti-Xa measurements were checked monthly throughout pregnancy (). Her serum AT activity level remained at 30% to 40%, but no thrombosis occurred during pregnancy. Her plasma D-dimer concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units, which were within the expected range for pregnant women. Nevertheless, peak anti-Xa activity levels ranged from 0 to 0.29 IU/mL in the second trimester. This activity was not consistent with the required dose ranging from 0.5 to 1 U/mL 2 to 4 hours following the injection. This finding indicated the phenomenon of HR.\nAfter 14 GW, she used LMWH as a bridge to warfarin, then she continued warfarin therapy before delivery. The international normalized ratio was monitored weekly to achieve a level between 2.0 and 3.0. She resumed LMWH and FFP from 37 GW. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37+4 GW. The patient delivered a healthy, 3165-g girl with Apgar scores of 10 at both 1 and 5 minutes. There were no adverse effects of the anticoagulation therapies. The patient and her newborn were discharged without morbidity 7 days later. She continued the same doses of LMWH with FFP, which was replaced with oral anticoagulant therapy from 6 weeks after delivery.

She was wheelchair bound due to disabling peripheral neuropathy and chronic leg pain. She reported that she had fractured her left wrist about 3 weeks prior to presentation. She also experienced femoral fracture about a year ago, that was managed conservatively.\nPhysical examination revealed a blood pressure of 153/81 mm Hg and pulse rate of 101 bpm. There was moderate swelling and tenderness over the right distal femur with limited range of motion of the right knee due to pain. Left forearm splint due to previous fracture was in place. Tenderness was also noted over tip of the right index finger. There was no distal neurovascular deficit in the extremities. Medications included aspirin of 81 mg per day, lisinopril of 40 mg per day, carvedilol of 25 mg twice a day, sevelamer carbonate of 800 mg thrice a day with meals, and insulin regimen.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed remarkable diffuse severe demineralization of the bones, with florid changes of renal osteodystrophy, prominent subligamentous resorption in the sacroiliac joints bilaterally, and widespread brown tumors ().\nWith normal serum calcium, high serum phosphate together with severely high PTH level, and history of non-compliance with medications and the dialysis treatment, the diagnosis of secondary (renal) hyperparathyroidism was made. Chart review revealed a history of long-standing severe hyperphosphatemia in the past explaining the presence of severe hyperparathyroidism despite current mild hyperphosphatemia (possibly now evolving toward more autonomous PTH secretion).\nTypical imaging stigmata of hyperparathyroidism including diffuse demineralization, insufficiency fractures, and brown tumors supported the diagnosis in this young woman.\nHer fractures were managed with non-operative treatment given her poor baseline functional status and severe hyperparathyroidism. The patient refused surgical parathyroidectomy. A high-dose phosphate binder (i.e. sevelamer carbonate) and also an oral calcimimetic (i.e. cinacalcet) were started for management of hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism.

On admission, his vital signs were body temperature 38.0 \u00b0C, blood pressure 98/44 mmHg, heart rate 82/min, and respiratory rate 16/min with an O2 saturation of 99% on room air. Upper abdominal tenderness was found without abdominal swelling or hepatosplenomegaly. Complete blood count showed white blood cells 9540/\u03bcL, haemoglobin 13.9 g/dL, and platelets 140 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. Biochemical parameters showed total bilirubin 0.56 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 58 IU/L, alanine transaminase 47 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen 6.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.23 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.7 mg/dL. Coagulation studies revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 92.4 s, elevated D-dimer 3.7 \u03bcg/mL, LA positivity, and slightly low prothrombin activity 58% (reference range [RR] 75\u2013135%) in combination with immunoglobin M (IgM) class anti-prothrombin antibody of 32.1 AU/mL (RR < 24.0 AU/mL). Immunoglobin G (IgG) class anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibody was also positive (> 50.0 units, RR < 2.0 units), which is associated with strong LA activity. The patient\u2019s LA-positive plasma was examined using the thrombin generation test and clot waveform analyses (Fig. a, b, and c) as previously described []. The clotting times in LA-positive plasma were significantly prolonged, compared to a healthy control.\nA diagnosis of LAHPS was made. The patient tested positive for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer 1:160, anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody of IgG 22 IU/mL, anticardiolipin antibody of IgG 16 U/mL, and anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibody of IgG > 50 units, but the patient did not fit the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 Classification Criteria []. A contrast-enhanced computed tomogram revealed nodular lesions in the adrenal glands bilaterally (Fig. d and e). The diagnosis of acute adrenal failure due to adrenal haemorrhage was made on the basis of the clinical manifestations, mild hyponatremia (134 mEq/L), high plasma ACTH 1586 pg/mL (RR 7.2\u201363.3), low plasma cortisol 3.24 \u03bcg/dL (RR 6.2\u201318.0), blood glucose 37 mg/dL, low serum aldosterone 43.1 pg/mL, and relatively elevated plasma renin activity 9.1 ng/mL/hr. Hence, the patient received glucose (0.6 g/kg/dose), hydration (1700 mL/m2), and hydrocortisone (50 mg/m2/day). Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were continued for the adrenal replacement therapy at physiological doses. Repeated coagulation studies still showed positive LA and prolonged aPTT for 12 months (Fig. a).\nAt 10 years of age, he visited our hospital because of gait disturbances and weakness in all extremities after acute upper respiratory viral infection. He had butterfly rash, discoid rash, optic disc swelling, deranged renal function, and showed higher levels of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody. Renal biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of lupus nephritis (Fig. b and c). His condition was diagnosed as SLE on the basis of the SLICC 2012 Classification Criteria []. Intravenous pulsed treatments with methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) were immediately initiated, followed by mycophenolate mofetil 400 mg/m2/day.

He was a social alcohol drinker and had a previous history of admission due to unknown origin hepatitis 3 yr before at our hospital, which the patient correlated with albendazole ingestion. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 150/70 mmHg, heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 20/min and body temperature 38.3\u2103. He had no recent history compatible with acute hypotension or having underlying heart disease. In the physical examination liver was not palpable, liver percussion span was normal and there was no remarkable finding except icteric sclerae. In laboratorial analysis WBC was 6,790/\u00b5L (eosinophil 8.2%), hemoglobin 15.7 g/dL, and platelet 147,000/\u00b5L showing mild increase of eosinophil count.

And after a new interrogation of his past medical history, we knew that he had a previous history of albendazole ingestion before hospital admission due to unknown origin toxic hepatitis 3 yr previously. We diagnosed the patient as toxic acute hepatitis due to the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) score of 9 and performed conservative medical treatment. The patient showed rapid improvement of liver function test with AST 35 IU/L, ALT 301 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 45 IU/L and total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL on 8th day of admission.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 15 7/12 years old female patient was admitted with complaints of fatigue and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed as type 1 diabetes mellitus two years ago and had never experienced an attack of DKA at the time of diagnosis or at follow-up. In the past 24 hours, she had complained of abdominal pain, was not able to eat, and had poor appetite. Her glycemic control showed mild hypoglycemia (61 mg/dL, 3.4 mmol/L) in the morning of admission. Due to poor appetite and hypoglycemia, the patient omitted her insulin dose at lunch time; the same evening, she felt worse and was brought to our emergency department by her parents. On physical examination, she was alert, dehydrated, had deep sighing respirations and smell of ketones. Her height was 168 cm (+1.02 SDS), weight 68 kg (+1.66 SDS), body mass index 24.1 kg/m2 (+1.08 SDS); respiratory rate was 38/min, pulse 80/min. She had normal body temperature (36.4\u00b0C, axillary) and normal blood pressure (110/80 mmHg). Blood glucose was 414 mg/dL (23 mmol/L), capillary pH was 6.99 and bicarbonate 5.0 mmol/L. Base excess was -25.2 mmol/L and anion gap was 29.8 mmol/L. Blood urea, liver enzymes and electrolytes were within normal limits (). After the initial saline bolus of 400mL/m2 over the first hour, insulin infusion was started at a rate of 0.05 U/kg/h in an infusion fluid containing 2 parts saline:1 part 5% dextrose, with added potassium.\nAt the 6th hour of treatment, the patient became agitated and tried to get up and walk. She could not be appeased and attacked the staff. She ripped off her infusion sets three times in 30 minutes. With a suspicion of brain edema, her head was elevated, fluid infusion was restricted by 1/3 and mannitol infusion was started. A cerebral computed tomography was performed immediately and showed no brain edema or hemorrhage. She had high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg) but no bradycardia. In the mean time, the patient was very agitated and we had to strap her to the bed as she injured two nurses. The acidosis could not be corrected because the insulin and fluid therapy was interrupted. At the eighth hour, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 9. In consultation with an anesthesiologist, 1 mg of midazolam was given for sedation, thus, we were able to start an iv line. At the 10th hour, to correct the acidosis, bicarbonate infusion was initiated with insulin 0.1 u/kg/h though her bicarbonate level was 7 mmol/L. Mannitol infusion was stopped since there was no improvement in consciousness. At the 12th hour, despite the improvement in acidosis, delirium still persisted. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at this time was reported as normal. Substance abuse and drug intoxication were suspected. The patient\u2019s blood pressure decreased to 130/90 mmHg, but tachypnea persisted. She was screaming, making incomprehensible sounds and was responding to painful stimuli. We continued with the same fluid infusion, but the rate of insulin was increased stepwise to 1.7 u/kg/h as serum glucose level did not decrease. At the 16th hour, the blood gas analyses showed a worsening (). This change was attributed to cessation of insulin and fluid infusion during the MRI. Therefore, the HCO3 infusion was repeated.\nAt the 18th hour of treatment, the patient developed a high fever. Serum C-reactive protein level was high (7.2 mg/dL; N: 0-0.8 mg/dL). Samples for blood and urine cultures were taken and iv ceftriaxone was started. Lumbar puncture was considered but postponed due to the instability of the patient. Retinal examination was normal. At this time, her agitated state disappeared and the patient began to sleep. At the 24th hour, acidosis had resolved completely, but she was still unconscious with little response to verbal stimuli. The patient had vulvovaginitis and treatment with fluconazole was started. In the following hours, consciousness improved slowly. At the 30th hour of treatment, she could open her eyes in response to calling her name. Finally, at the 36th hour, the patient was able to obey commands and sit up. The fluid and insulin infusions were stopped and subcutaneous insulin was started. The patient could not remember the delirium episode and no neurological sequelae were observed.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 65-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with HIV infection in October 2005. There were no comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. cART, comprising lamivudine, abacavir and atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg of atazanavir boosted by 100 mg of ritonavir), was started to treat his low CD4+ T-cell count (205 cells/\u03bcL) and high HIV-RNA (230 000 copies/mL) in June 2006. Soon after the initiation of cART, both proteinuria and hematuria emerged (1+ and 1+ on dipstick test, respectively) and his renal function started to decline slowly, yet there were no crystalline precipitates in the urine. Serum creatinine (Cr) increased from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL in June 2009, and to 1.4 mg/dL in February 2012, with persistent proteinuria (1+) and occult hematuria (2+) on a dipstick test. As serum Cr increased to 1.7 mg/dL, he was admitted to the Department of Nephrology in April 2012. The cART regimen remained unchanged, since the control of HIV infection was good at the time.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 102/78 mmHg and pulse rate 98 beats per minute. His height was 154 cm and his weight was 35.4 kg (body mass index, 14.9 kg/m2). There were no particular abnormalities on physical examination. The blood data were as follows: white blood cell count 6400/\u03bcL; red blood cell count 387 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL; platelet count 27.0 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; serum urea nitrogen 21 mg/dL; serum Cr 1.7 mg/dL; serum sodium 139 mEq/L; serum potassium 4.5 mEq/L; serum chloride 103 mEq/L and serum C-reactive protein 0.49 mg/dL. Urine dipstick test showed pH 6.0, proteinuria (1+), and occult blood (3+). The urinary concentrations of biomarkers for tubular damage, which was corrected for urinary Cr concentrations, were as follows: N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), 12.0 IU/gCr (normal level of NAG concentration, 0.0\u20137.0 IU/L) and \u03b22M, 391 \u03bcg/gCr (normal level of \u03b22M concentration, 27\u2013265 \u03bcg/L), respectively. The daily amount of urinary protein was 250 mg. Urinary sediments included 50\u201399 red blood cells/high power field (HPF), 20\u201329 white blood cells/HPF and small amounts of crystalline precipitation (no detail for its shape). Infrared spectroscopic analysis was implemented to test whether the urinary crystalline precipitation included atazanavir crystals. In brief, the patient's urine was stored for 24 h, and some of the urine was centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was used for infrared spectroscopic analysis, and the spectrum of the infrared absorbance was compared with that of the standard for atazanavir analysis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). This analysis strongly indicated that the urinary crystalline precipitation of the patient included atazanavir crystals (Figure ). The first renal biopsy was performed in May 2012. The kidney tissue contained eight glomeruli, one of which (12.5%) was globally sclerotic. The remaining glomeruli showed no convincing histological changes indicating renal failure. In contrast, interstitial nephritis, accompanied by diffuse inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, was noted (Figure A). Moreover, needle-shaped crystalline precipitation, likely in the epithelia of the tubule, surrounded by multinuclear giant cells, was very characteristic (Figure B). Immunohistochemistry was negative. Electron microscopy showed no electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli; however, crystalline precipitation was confirmed within the tubular epithelial cells (Figure C). In June 2012, atazanavir was replaced by raltegravir, but renal function did not improve. From November 2012, 6 months after the first renal biopsy, oral prednisolone was started at the initial dose of 0.75 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks, and was slowly decreased in the subsequent 5 months. However, serum Cr remained constant at 1.5 mg/dL. In August 2013 (1 year and 3 months after the first renal biopsy), a second renal biopsy contained 28 glomeruli, 5 of which (17.9%) were globally sclerotic. The remaining 23 glomeruli had unremarkable changes. Needle-shaped crystals surrounded by lymphocytes and multinuclear giant cells in the tubulointerstitial compartment were completely removed. Sclerotic findings of glomeruli and intrarenal arterioles including interlobular arteries were more prominent than those observed in the first renal biopsy. Additionally, tubular atrophy and interstitial-fibrosis developed further, although the severe interstitial inflammation was almost cured (Figure D). Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed no characteristic findings.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombi and deep venous thrombus in the lower limb (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a right ventricular thrombus (Fig. ). She was referred to our hospital at 28 weeks of gestation after insertion of IVC filter and heparin administration. Fetal development was normal. Due to the mobility of right ventricular thrombus and the risk of cardiac arrest, an emergency thrombectomy was planned. An intracardiac echography probe (AcuNav\u2122; Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) was inserted via the right femoral vein to monitor the umbilical artery pulse wave via Doppler, in addition to transabdominal fetal monitoring. After induction of anesthesia, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was undetectable; hence, emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed via median sternotomy, followed by cardiac resuscitation. While switching to extracorporeal circulation approximately 10 min after the hemodynamic collapse, the fetal heart rate decreased to approximately 80 beats per minute. Immediately after establishing extracorporeal circulation, the fetal heart rate recovered rapidly and remained stable throughout the procedure, while the CPB average perfusion pressure was maintained above 70 mmHg. Thrombectomy and tricuspid valve plication were performed under cardiac arrest (Fig. ). Catecholamines and nitric oxide were administered at a concentration of 20 ppm to treat hypotension and pulmonary hypertension, respectively, during withdrawal from CPB. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit without chest closure. Total time for surgery, anesthesia, cardiopulmonary, and aortic cross clamp was 345, 483, 208, and 147 min, respectively. The total volume of hemorrhage, transfusion, infusion, urine, and water balance was 1470, 3600, 2150, 1520, and +657 ml, respectively. Chest closure was performed on postoperative day 3 and extubation on postoperative day 6. Heparin administration was resumed after confirming postoperative hemostasis. At 32 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess the fetal brain function; no remarkable changes were observed. The patient was discharged with subcutaneous injection of heparin calcium, due to persistent lower limb thrombus.\nShe was readmitted at 38 weeks of gestation. Labor was induced at 40 weeks using oxytocin, after discontinuation of heparin. Epidural anesthesia was administered to protect the thoracic wound site and reduce the cardiac load. An epidural catheter was placed between the L3-L4 vertebrae, after confirming the recovery of hemostatic function by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time. Continuous epidural ropivacaine 0.1% with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl was administered through patient controlled epidural analgesia. Analgesia was adequate throughout labor, with no hemodynamic changes.

His co-morbidities included atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac failure, ulcerative colitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and antiphospholipid syndrome with a past history of recurrent deep vein thromboses; he was receiving maintenance warfarin therapy. On examination he was apyrexial, BP 200/132, HR 68, BM 9.1, chest was clear, there was mild to moderate epigastric tenderness with normal bowel sounds and mild resolving cellulitis of the right calf.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated a paced rhythm and chest X-ray was consistent with slight fluid overload, cardiomegaly and interstitial shadowing. The initial impression was possible gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. However tenderness was a prominent feature on examination, and in view of his co-morbidities it was important to rule out sepsis or malignancy.\nWarfarin was withheld, vitamin K administered, and intravenous fluids given. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed (Figure ) which revealed subtle, non-specific bilateral adrenal enhancing lesions, the differential diagnosis for which included metastases, infection, granulomatous disease or haemorrhage.

Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and normal S1 and S2 with S3 gallop as well as a triphasic friction rub (one systolic and two diastolic sounds) at cardiac auscultation. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated 1-2 mm ST elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, and V4\u2013V6, as well as ST depression and PR elevation at aVR (). A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on admission showed an apical akinesia with a preserved basal function, a mild pericardial effusion, an ejection fraction of 40%, and a moderate mitral regurgitation ().\nAfter finding wall motion abnormality on TTE and because of persistent chest pain, despite the initial clinical diagnosis of acute pericarditis, the patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheter laboratory in order to look for any coronary artery disease requiring intervention. CAG demonstrated a severe muscle bridge at mid portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and otherwise normal coronary arteries (); left ventriculography showed characteristic systolic ballooning of the apex in favor of TCM (). Result of the laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated serum levels of cardiac enzymes: creatine kinase MB = 30 ng/mL (normal range < 25 ng/mL) and troponin I = 0.89 ng/mL (normal range < 0.01).\nThe patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril 6.25 mg three times per day), a diuretic (furosemide 20 mg three times per day), and a beta-blocker (carvedilol 3.125 two times per day).

Although parental consanguinity was not reported to be present, the family history revealed that they were living in a village of only 500 inhabitants. The patient\u2019s mother, who was first pregnancy and primigravida, had no symptoms during pregnancy of excessive androgen production, such as hair loss, virilisation, or acne. On physical examination, height, weight, and phallus were measured to be 154.9 cm [standard deviation score (SDS): -2.5], 57 kg (SDS: -0.6), and 2 cm respectively. Breast tissue and palpable gonads were not detected. Prader stage 3, two urogenital openings and stage 2 pubic pilosity were also noted. On laboratory examination, bone age was 11 years. Gonadotropin concentrations were: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 70 mIU/mL (1.5-12.8 mIU/L); luteinizing hormone (LH) 30 mIU/mL (0.1-12 mIU/mL); free testosterone 0.9 pg/mL (0.8-1.4 pg/mL); and estradiol 22.9 pg/mL (7-60 pg/mL). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were all found to be in the normal range. Pelvic ultrasonography (USG) revealed 19x14 mm right ovary and 15x12 mm left ovary and an absence of uterus. Karyotype was 46,XX and no variants were found in the SRY gene on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. On laparoscopic examination normal-looking bilateral ovaries and a small uterus were observed. The biopsy findings of the right gonad were consistent with ovarian tissue and ovarian follicle cysts were observed. Sequence analysis of the SOX9 gene revealed no mutation. Clinical and laboratory findings of the patient suggested aromatase deficiency and a novel homozygous nonsense p.R115X (c.343 C>T) pathogenic variant was found on Sanger sequencing of the CYP19A1 gene (). Both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation (, ). There were no unusual clinical findings in the parents. The mutation found in the cases was predicted to be pathogenic by in\nsilico analysis by Varsome program (https://varsome.com/).\nThe Institutional Council of Disorders of Sex Development decided that the case should be raised male on the ground of a more distinct male sexual identity. Salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy and genitoplasty were performed. Intramuscular testosterone propionate and testosterone phenylpropionate treatments were administered with a 100 mg/month starting dose and gradually increased every six months. Oral estradiol hemihydrate treatment of 0.25 mg/day was initiated in the follow-up. At the age of 21, bilateral testicular prostheses were surgically implanted. During follow-up bone mineral densitometry showed early onset osteoporosis (L1-L4 bone mineral density Z score: -2,2) and oral calcium supplementation was given. Calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D concentrations were within normal limit.

The patient was admitted to the emergency general surgical service for complaints of acute onset colicky periumbilical abdominal pain, progressive abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting for 2 days. Emesis was described as non-bloody and non-bilious. Other pertinent history included one bowel movement 12 h prior to admission, which was non-bloody and inability to pass flatus for more than 24 h. No previous episode of abdominal pain of similar nature were elicitated. Physical examination was significant for mild abdominal distension and generalized tenderness to palpation in all quadrants without signs of peritonitis. Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Significant laboratory findings were INR of 2.20 (on warfarin for valve replacement), hyponatremia of 125, acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.56. computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was significant for high-grade small bowel obstruction with a swirling of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) suggesting rotation of intestinal mesentery (Fig. ) []. The SMV was located to the right of SMA, a reliable finding against intestinal malrotation [] (Fig. ). Further, there was no radiologic evidence of malrotation like transposition of SMA and SMV, the horizontal part of the duodenum not reaching medioventral line, and malposition of ileocecal junction [].

Her medical history included a hysterectomy 30 years ago. From several decades ago, she had almost always voided with abdominal strain. Also, she suffered from tenesmus and weak stream. On examination, she was oriented and cooperative. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 150/75 mmHg; pulse, 84 beats per minute and regular; respirations, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 36.0\u2103. Clinical examination revealed diffuse pain in the right abdomen with tenderness. However, costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness was not prominent. Bowel sounds were increased.\nUrinalysis showed 2 to 4 red cells and 0 to 1 white cells per field under high-power magnification. Complete blood cell count results were as follows: 8,500/mm3, with 44.5% neutrophils. Serum chemical analysis showed a urea level of 26 mg/dl, a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dl, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.99 mg/dl. Other values were within the normal limits.\nAfter analgesic injection, her pain subsided. With a presumptive diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, she was discharged with medication.\nThe following day, the patient was admitted to the gastrointestinal department with persistent right abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed, which showed a dilated urinary bladder, hydronephroureterosis, and perinephric fluid collection. The patient was referred to our urologists, who recommended insertion of an indwelling Foley catheter. About 2 L of urine was drained shortly after catheter indwelling. Because there was no delayed phase on CT, we performed a non-enhanced CT scan immediately. It showed extravasation of radiocontrast from the right upper ureter at the L3 to 4 transverse process level and improved hydronephroureterosis ().\nA 8.5 F pigtail percutaneous nephrostomy catheter was inserted into the renal pelvis. After 7 days, antegrade pyelography (AGP) performed through the nephrostomy catheter showed no extravasation of radiocontrast from the ureter (). A double-J catheter (6 F, 24 cm) was placed in the right ureter. The percutaneous nephrostomy catheter and Foley catheter were removed. The next day, she was discharged without complications.\nAfter 2 weeks, the Double-J catheter was removed and we subsequently performed a video-urodynamic study. A total of 500 ml of normal saline was filled in the bladder. The patient then tried to void with abdominal straining, but could not. Maximal detrusor pressure did not exceed 10 cmH2O. In other words, the patient showed detrusor underactivity and no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). A follow-up CT scan was performed 2 months later. It showed resorption of urinoma in the right peri-renal space and there was neither malignancy nor obstructing lesions.

The patient complained of generalized myalgias, nonproductive cough, and runny nose in the preceding few days for which she called her primary care physician and was given a script of oseltamivir, attributing the symptoms to influenza virus infection. Pertinent past medical history included hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, with the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45 milliequivalent/liter, and type II diabetes (DMT-2). Her medications included metformin, pioglitazone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe. She used to live by herself and didn\u2019t drink or smoke. Vitals in the ER were temperature: 93 F, pulse: 55/min, blood pressure: 96/54 mmHg, oxygen saturation: 98% on ambient air, and respiratory rate: 28/min.\nPhysical examination showed that she was lethargic and oriented only to self, with dry mucosal membranes and cold, clammy skin. The neck was supple; extraocular movements were intact. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The rest of the examination, including the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, were unremarkable. Pertinent laboratory evaluation, including complete metabolic profile (CMP) showed serum glucose of 187 mg/dL, creatinine: 11.5 mg/dL (baseline 1.8 mg/dl), sodium: 131 meq/L, potassium: 7.9 meq/L, bicarbonate: 5 meq/L, anion gap: 35, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.2 mg/dL. Complete blood count (CBC) showed hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, platelets 370,000/uL, and white blood cells (WBC): 9.3 k/uL. The coagulation profile was normal. The lactic acid level was eight (8) meq/L. Venous blood gas analysis showed pH: 7.009, pCO2: 18.2 mmHg, and bicarbonate level: 5.1 mmol/L. Serum osmolarity was 312 mOsm/kg, with an osmolar anion gap of 12 mOsm/kg. Urinalysis showed glucose of 500 mg/dL, proteinuria of 30 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a first-degree heart block and broad QRS complex, as shown in Figure .\nComputerized tomographic scan (CT) head and chest X-ray were unremarkable.\nShe was aggressively resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluids. Hyperkalemia was treated with IV insulin, dextrose, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and inhaled albuterol. Urgent hemodialysis was also arranged. Attributing her acute severe metabolic acidosis to influenza complicated by bacterial superinfection, she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and oseltamivir, and workup for acute renal failure, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), complement levels, urine eosinophils, and renal ultrasound, was ordered. After hemodialysis (HD), electrolytes improved to a bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 meq/L, and a pH of 7.433. She remained hemodynamically stable at this point. Repeat metabolic profile (BMP) fours hour after the completion of HD showed the bicarbonate level dropping down to 13 meq/L again. Endocrinology was consulted due to persistent metabolic acidosis. At this point, the patient recalled that she was also taking dapagliflozin (an SGLT-2 inhibitor) up to two weeks before the presentation when she stopped taking it due to her improving HbA1c.\nHer serum beta-hydroxybutyrate result came back at 92.5 mg/dl. She was started on IV insulin and dextrose. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate started improving and resolved entirely within 15 hours of beginning IV insulin, and bicarbonate improved to 22 meq/l. Later on, her urine output improved and electrolytes stabilized without further need for HD. Creatinine trended down and stabilized at 2.5 meq/L.\nShe resumed a regular diet, and beta-hydroxybutyrate remained within the normal range. Her blood sugar levels remained in the range of 110-150 mg/dl without hypoglycemic agents. Workup for acute renal failure came back negative.

She had mild abdominal tenderness, but there was no obvious hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Digital rectal examination revealed melena.\nLaboratory tests indicated a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 26.0 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.64 mg/dL. Her serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 232 U/L (106- 211 U/L) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor level was 213 U/mL (145- 519 U/mL) (Table ).\nUrgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed an ulcerative lesion with fresh blood clots in the transverse part of the duodenum (Figure ). Based on the location and shape of the lesion, we suspected not only a peptic ulcer, but also an ulcer caused by vascular malformation or malignancy. Therefore, we decided to interrupt the endoscopy and perform contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed slight localized contrast enhancement on the wall of the transverse part of the duodenum in the early phase of contrast injection (Figure ). No vascular lesions were observed, and there was no extravasation of contrast agent in the delayed phase. EGD was immediately resumed again for further observation of the lesion. When we removed the blood clots, a protruding vessel was seen at the base of the ulcer, which was coagulated using hemostatic forceps (Coagrasper; Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) (Figure ).\nFollowing this hemostatic treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital without re-bleeding. The lesion that caused the bleeding was suspected to be a malignant tumor of the duodenum based on its location. EGDs, including forceps biopsies from the ulcerative lesion, were performed three times after the initial hemostatic treatment. While the first and second biopsies revealed no malignancy, the third biopsy showed findings suggestive of malignant lymphoma. On pathological evaluation, diffuse proliferation of atypical medium-sized lymphoid cells was seen in the entire mucosa, along with a few intraepithelial lesions (Figure and ). No necrosis was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the cells were positive for CD3 and CD56, and negative for CD4, CD5, CD8, CD20 and EBER (Figure -).\nAt this point, MEITL was suspected, and examinations for systemic lesions were subsequently performed. No abnormal lymphocytes were found on iliac bone marrow examination. 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (18FDG-PET/CT) showed nodular FDG accumulation in the wall of the transverse part of the duodenum, consistent with the findings of contrast-enhanced CT (Figure ).

Chest radiograph with diffuse interstitial infiltrate in both lungs was demonstrated. Renal ultrasound showed increased kidney size with increased renal parenchymal echogenicity consistent with parenchymal disease.\nTwenty-four hours after admission, peritoneal dialysis was started. The next day, creatinine and uremia continued to increase. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed and intravenous steroid pulses at 10 mg/kg/day were begun.\nSerology tests demonstrated the presence of positive C-ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence with documented proteinase 3-specific ANCA (PR3-ANCA). P-ANCA and peroxidase-specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (MPO-ANCA) were negative. Rheumatoid factor and C3, C4 complement levels were normal. Anti-DNA antibody titers measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by immunofluorescence were at normal levels. Viral serology (hepatitis B and C, HIV), and blood and throat cultures were negative. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers were within the normal limits.\nDiagnosis of renal involvement was confirmed through biopsy. Microscopic optic study in 20 glomeruli revealed renal parenchyma with less than 50% glomeruli presenting segmental capillary fibrinoid necrosis with neutrophil exudate surrounding glomeruli. Tubule interstitial infiltrate was also shown (). Cellular crescent was seen in 20% of the glomeruli ().

She was a well-developed, nonobese woman in no significant distress and nontachypneic. Pertinent physical exam findings included no jugular venous distention, no crackles audible at base of lungs, heart with regular rate and rhythm with no extra sounds or murmurs, nondistended abdomen, trace peripheral leg edema, and no visible rashes. Laboratory tests were significant for sodium 129 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, CO2 20 mEq/L, BUN 46 mg/dL, and creatinine 3.4 mg/dL. Her baseline creatinine based on the most recent reading one month prior to admission was 1.1 mg/dL. Urinalysis was significant for a specific gravity of 1.006, RBC 142, and WBC 8 per HPF. No casts of dysmorphic cells were seen. Proteinuria was 2+, and a random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 1.48.\nHer creatinine continued to rise rapidly, and by day 6 of hospitalization it was 6.4 mg/dL. Due to these findings, a renal biopsy was performed. Up to 21 glomeruli were present per tissue section, and two of them showed global sclerosis. Two other glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis and the remaining glomeruli were open. There was global diffuse marked mesangial sclerosis and hypercellularity, and there was no obvious endocapillary cell proliferation or inflammatory cell infiltrate. Three of the open glomeruli also displayed segmental or circumferential predominantly cellular crescent. There was multifocal chronic tubulointerstitial injury characterized by atrophic tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and mild mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate, all which accounted for about 20-40% of the cortical tissue area.

Immunofluorescent staining showed marked IgA and C3 mesangial deposition, weak linear IgG staining of the glomerular basement membrane, and absence of C4 and C1q which was consistent with IgA nephropathy. There are also changes suggestive of diabetic nephropathy, in keeping with the clinical history of diabetes. These changes include thickened lamina densa and linear IgG of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial sclerosis. Immunofluorescent staining positive for IgA and C3 is seen in Figures and , respectively. Staining for C4 and C1q was both negative with the latter seen on . In addition, electron microscopy showed uniform thickening of lamina densa of glomerular basement membrane, marked mesangial sclerosis, and hypercellularity, and some electron dense deposits were identified in the mesangial areas and subepithelial location which can be seen in Figures and . Ultimately, given the histological findings, the biopsy was diagnosed as mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescent formation. Findings were not comparable with lupus nephritis, especially the immunofluorescent findings. The significant mesangial IgA staining raised the likelihood of IgA nephropathy.\nHer serologic work-up included anti-dsDNA antibody (1:80), ANA (1:320), and normal serum complement levels. With these biopsy results in the setting of worsening kidney function, she was diagnosed with immune complex RPGN secondary to IgAN.\nShe subsequently received intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for three days and five rounds of plasmapheresis.

On the third day of admission, the patient's potassium level (3.2 mmol/L) and kidney function (Bun 23 mg/dL, Cr 2.57 mg/dL, eGFR 30 mL/min) were getting better, but he was getting deteriorated with drowsy consciousness. The brain computed tomography revealed no significant findings. Tracing his medical history, he was diagnosed as a bipolar affective disorder for 20 years. He was under regular follow-up in the psychiatric clinic with lithium carbonate 600 mg twice daily, risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and flurazepam 60 mg once daily. He was still taking the same dosage during these days after surgery. Lithium level was found to be 3.42 mEq/L and lithium toxicity was diagnosed. Lithium carbonate was discontinued immediately, and urgent hemodialysis was suggested by nephrologist.\nAfter 3 courses of hemodialysis, his serum lithium level subsequently declined to 0.63 mEq/L and creatinine level to 1.58 mg/dL, while his consciousness returned normal. In the following days, neurologic sequelae were noted by muscle weakness (muscle power 2 points over bilateral dorsi-flexors and plantar-flexors) and pain sensation in both feet. The nerve conduction test revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy with conduction block. The patient was discharged thirty-five days after admission, while his serum lithium and creatinine level declined to 0.06 mEq/L and 1.05 mg/dl, respectively. He was advised to keep a passive range of motion exercise until the nerve function recovers. Lithium carbonate was replaced by lamotrigine now.\n\nWhat is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", "output": "### Response:\n-12.0", "task": "calc"}

Patient was one of the two siblings of non consanguineous parents with no family history of orofacial or acral malformations. Detailed history revealed that the antenatal, neonatal and infancy had been uneventful. However, she was diagnosed as having atrial septal defect at the age of 7 years and had undergone surgical management for the same. Patient also reported history of menstrual irregularities (menarche achieved at the age of 16 years). She was moderately built, well nourished and appeared to have normal intelligence. Patient's height was 167 cm, within 75th percentile while weight (42 kgs) and head circumference (20 inches) were both below 3rd percentile. Routine general physical examination revealed broad halluces bilaterally exhibiting valgus deformity and dysmorphic nails []. In addition, duplication of 5th toe of right foot with syndactyly of the supernumerary digit with 5th toe was evident. There was flexion contraction of 4th and 5th toe of left foot and 4th toe of right foot. The upper limbs were essentially normal except for broadened right thumb and nail, and clinodactyly bilaterally []. No functional deficit in relation to hands or feet was noticed. On extra oral examination, acrocephalic skull, flattened frontal and occipital regions and low hairline was evident. The leptoprosopic flat face with mild maxillary hypoplasia and relative mandibular prognathism was exemplified by a prominent chin []. An increase in gonial angle was evident on profile view. Nose was long, thin, pointed with the nasofrontal angle flattened presenting as wide root of the nose. Thick eyebrows, prominent eyelashes, mild convergent strabismus and marginal hypertelorism were present. Intra-oral examination revealed high arched palate and generalized enamel hypoplasia []. Patient was currently undergoing orthodontic treatment for correction of crowding within the arches. Also anterior deep bite with 100% overlap of mandibular teeth was evident []. Patient gave previous history of endodontic treatment and apicoectomy of 31, 41 and at the time of presentation had pain in the same region along with vestibular obliteration and tenderness.\nOrthopantomogram confirmed a cystic lesion in mandibular anterior region, increased gonial angles bilaterally and occlusal plane irregularities []. Further radiographic examination of craniofacial skeleton (P-A skull [] and Lateral skull radiographs [] revealed evidence of coronal sutural synostosis with prominent copper beaten appearance, flattened occiput and frontal bones, shallow orbits, gross prognathism with obtuse mandibular plane angle, maxillary sinus hyperpneumatization and falx calcification. Hand and wrist radiograph showed short and broad distal phalynx of right thumb, however all bones were otherwise normal. Radiograph of feet [] revealed duplication of distal phalynx of halluces and valgus deformity at distal interphalyngeal joint bilaterally. There was also evidence of partial duplication of 5th toe; Y-shaped proximal phalynx with one supernumerary phalynx in postaxial position exhibiting soft tissue syndactyly with 5th toe. Fourth and fifth digits of left foot were bent in clinically fixed flexion.\nThe diagnosis of Robinow-Sorauf syndrome was made based on clinical and imaging features. Surgical enucleation of radicular cyst and apicoectomy of mandibular anteriors was done following intentional root canal treatment of 32 and 42. Opinion regarding surgical correction of limb anomalies was sought.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe patient is a 57-year-old man (height, 173.5 cm; weight, 61.7 kg), and the remaining teeth in his lower jaw were 1, 2, and 3 on the right side and 1, 4, and 5 on the left side. The patient had chronic apical periodontitis and severe periodontal disease. There was teeth movement, and it was difficult to preserve them. We planned to extract these teeth and place six implants (Figure ).\nA physician had suspected the presence of VWD when the patient was aged 21 years, but no detailed testing or treatment was performed. The family history was not relevant, and the patient was on no current medications.\nIn terms of preoperative chest findings, the chest X-ray was normal (Figure ) with a normal cardiothoracic ratio of 42%, and there were no particular issues. Blood test results are shown in Table . The platelet count, a hemostatic factor, was 360,000/\u00b5l, the activated partial thromboplastin time was 35.4 s, and the prothrombin time was 11.7 s; all were within normal limits. However, coagulation factor VIII was 49%, VWF activity was 24%, and VWF antigen was 26% indicating that the coagulation factor was lower than normal. Based on detailed testing carried out by our hospital's hematology department, the patient was diagnosed with Type 1 VWD, in which there is a quantitative decrease in the VWF.\nThere was nothing of particular note in terms of family history. Implants in the upper jaw had already been placed at a different hospital, and there had been some difficulty stopping the bleeding when the teeth were extracted. In this case, after consulting with the hematology department, we decided that surgery would be possible by transfusing heat-treated factor VIII concentrate (Confact F\u00ae), which contains VWF. This transfusion was done to prevent abnormal bleeding during surgery. Furthermore, considering the risk of bleeding due to fluctuations in hemodynamics, with the patient's consent, we planned to carry out tooth extraction and implant placement under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation.\nOne hour before entering the operating room, 1500 units of Confact F\u00ae were transfused. In terms of transfusion volume, although we planned to carry out implant placement, it was determined that the amount of bleeding would not differ greatly from that of tooth extraction alone, so we used 25 IU/kg, basing our calculations on those published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Table ). Immediately before surgery, we took another blood sample. We confirmed that VWF activity was 127% and that coagulation factor VIII had increased to 104%. We then proceeded with the surgery. Considering that fluctuations in hemodynamics during surgery promote bleeding, intravenous sedation was performed to stabilize circulation. Oxygen (2 L/min) was administered transnasally, and cefmetazole sodium (1 g) was administered preoperatively to prevent infection. During the operation, we used midazolam iv and propofol (1% Diprivan Injection kit\u00ae) target-controlled infusion for continuous intravenous sedation. Also, 2% Xylocaine Dental\u00ae with epinephrine 1:80,000 was used for local anesthesia. The operation time was 3 h and 37 min, the anesthesia time was 4 h and 16 min, and blood loss was 405 ml. Although it was a little difficult to stop bleeding during the operation, we completed the procedure with no major problems. No postoperative complications, such as bleeding, were observed, and the prognosis was favorable. One week after the operation, evaluation of the coagulation factor VIII and VWF activity revealed that they had decreased to 48% and 23%, respectively, which were close to their preoperative values (Table ).\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n69.106", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 45-year-old male with no past medical history was transferred to our tertiary care facility after presenting to a community hospital with a one-week history of generalized abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and lower extremity edema. His initial evaluation revealed severe hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases, prompting his transfer. He denied any alcohol consumption for the previous twenty years or intravenous drug use. He had no medical history, was taking no medications prior to presentation, except a multivitamin. He denied taking any herbal supplements and his family history was unremarkable. He was married and employed as an auto mechanic.\nOn examination, he was notably jaundiced and cachectic in appearance with a height of 1.7 m, weight of 82.5 kg, and body mass index (BMI) of 28.3 kg/m2. He was afebrile with a pulse of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygen saturation of 95% while on room air. He had marked scleral icterus; proptosis was noted. On thyroid examination, he had a large symmetrical, non-tender goiter with audible bruit. Heartbeat was irregularly irregular. His abdomen was mildly tender diffusely without ascites or organomegaly. Mild bilateral lower extremity edema was present. Skin was warm to the touch. A fine tremor was noted; asterixis of hands was intermittently present.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL (13.5-16.5), platelet count of 115 k/\u00b5L (150-400), and white blood cell count of 11.8 k/\u00b5L (4.5-11). His international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.4. His serum sodium was 128 mmol/L (137-147), potassium of 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5.1) with creatinine of 1.77 mg/dL (0.4-1.24), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 57 mg/dL (7-25) and serum glucose 159 mg/dL (70-100). Notably, his total bilirubin was 19.8 mg/dL (0.3-1.2), direct bilirubin 13.8 mg/dL (<0.4), alkaline phosphatase 332 U/L (25-110), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 86 U/L (7-40), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 50 U/L (7-56). His gamma-glutamyltransferase was 20 U/L (9-64). Total iron was 32 mcg/dL (50-185), percent iron saturation 11% (28%-42%), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was 283 mcg/dL (270-380), and ferritin 121 ng/mL (30-300). The patient also had negative serology for hepatitis A, B, and C.\nA workup for thyroid dysfunction demonstrated a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.026 mcg/mL (0.35-5.00) with a free T4 of 4.3 ng/dL (0.6-1.6), free T3 4.6 pg/mL (2.1-3.9), and total T3 125 ng/dL (87-180). TSH receptor antibody was>40 IU/L (0.00 \u22121.75) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was >1000 IU/mL (<5.61). An ultrasound of the patient's thyroid was notable for a mildly enlarged heterogeneous and hypervascular thyroid without nodularity. Based on these findings along with his presenting symptoms and signs, the patient was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease.\nIn light of worsening cholestatic jaundice (Figure ), a thorough hepatology evaluation was undertaken for potential autoimmune, infectious, and primary hepatobiliary causes of cholestasis. The laboratory testing were all negative. Cardiac evaluation was notable for an ejection fraction of 55%-60% with right ventricular dilation and moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate left atrial and severe right atrial enlargement was found with elevated central venous pressure as well as pulmonary artery pressure. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated increase echogenicity of the liver and revealed trace abdominal and pelvic ascites. Further workup for cholestatic jaundice included a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which was notable for fatty liver, cardiomegaly, and diffuse irregular appearance of bones with prominent trabecula. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed normal caliber common bile duct and common hepatic duct with normal intrahepatic ducts, without filling defects, strictures, or stenosis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was notable for normal pancreatic parenchyma as well as normal pancreatic and common bile ducts. The patient subsequently underwent transjugular liver biopsy with unremarkable hepatic vein pressures and a corrected sinusoidal pressure gradient of 5-6 mm Hg (normal). Pathology showed cholestasis and mild ductal proliferation with focal pericholangitis but no hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, hepatocellular injury, or necrosis. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) diastase digestion showed normal glycogen content without unusual intrahepatic inclusions; hepatic iron stores were normal.\nPrior to transfer to our facility, he was initially stabilized with intravenous diltiazem drip 5 mg per hour titrated for rate control of his atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, in combination with hydrocortisone 50 mg every eight hours and propylthiouracil (PTU) 150 mg every six hours for management of thyrotoxicosis. Due to concern for fulminant liver failure, urgent transfer was pursued to our facility. Upon arrival, the patient's thyrotoxicosis and resultant atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure were managed aggressively given his calculated Burch-Wartofsky score of 45. PTU was stopped in light of FDA black box warning, and methimazole was initiated at a dose of 20 mg every 8 hours; corticosteroids were continued for management of thyroid storm until normalization of total T3. The patient experienced gradual improvement in his free T4 (Figure ). His atrial fibrillation was managed with oral digoxin 125 \u00b5g after digitalizing doses and metoprolol 100 mg oral twice daily.\nWhile the index of concern for acute liver failure prompted a swift and extensive investigation, it was entirely negative for primary hepatobiliary causes of his cholestasis including ERCP, EUS, and transjugular liver biopsy. Based on negative rheumatologic, autoimmune, and infectious causes workup, it was concluded that his cholestatic jaundice was related to Graves\u2019 disease related thyrotoxicosis. This clinical hunch was further solidified with his clinical and metabolic improvement (Table ). Total bilirubin was 13.9 mg/dL on admission to the outside facility, peaking 17 days later at 39.1 mg/dL and improving to 14.0 mg/dL two weeks following discharge. An important point that needs to be made was his high bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, which was markedly elevated at 103 mcg/L (0-20), demonstrating a high bone turnover state related to his hyperthyroidism. The patient was discharged two weeks after his hospitalization with plans for definitive outpatient management of Graves\u2019 disease.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n122.5", "task": "calc"}

A tuberculin skin test was negative. Sputum cultures for bacterial, fungal and mycobacteria were negative.\nA CT scan of the chest with contrast () showed diffuse alveolar bilateral patchy infiltrates, with some emphysematous changes. The lung infiltrates had a ground glass appearance. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring, and started on empiric antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia to exclude Goodpasture's syndrome in view of hemoptysis and hematuria. Further laboratory tests including ANA, anti-GBM IgG, complements, viral hepatitis screen, ESR, CRP, VWF, ANCA, sputum AFB \u00d73 and coagulation panel, were all within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate hemocult-positive stool did not reveal any active evidence of gastro-intestinal bleeding.\nHe continued to have massive (>500 mL/day) hemoptysis and hematuria with subsequent decline in the hematocrit necessitating transfusion of a total of 3 units of packed red cells. He underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage which showed the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages and bloody exudate. To establish the cause of the pulmonary\u2013renal presentation of this patient, a kidney biopsy was done.\nRenal biopsy () showed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with IgA deposition. The patient was started on intravenous cyclophosphamide 1 g and prednisone 60 mg daily. Over a 4-day period, his hemoptysis gradually resolved, and hemoglobin and hematocrit stabilized at 10.9 gm/dL and 32.1%, respectively. The patient was then started on intravenous cyclophosphamide infusion 1 gm monthly with daily oral prednisone tapered by 10 mg every month. He completed six cycles of monthly cyclophosphamide.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 4-year-old 19-kg male child suffered from sudden onset of abdominal pain and fever for about 5 days. Parents reported no significant past medical or surgical history. On arrival at our hospital, the patient had stable hemodynamics with a body temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, a pulse rate of 94 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 124/79mm Hg, and a decreased urine output. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended mildly, and bowel sound was absent. Abdominal tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant without rebounding pain was found. Rectal examination showed yellowish stool that was Hemoccult-negative. Laboratory data were as follows: total white blood cell count, 17.2\u00d7109/L with a significant left shift; hematocrit, 34.9%; serum amylase, 61U/L; serum lipase, 19U/L and serum C-reactive protein, 78.21 mg/mL. The abdominal radiograph showed normal bowel gas pattern and no abnormal free air was identified. Abdominal sonography showed a hypoechoic mass with debris. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast showed an abscess measuring 22\u00d725\u00d724 mm in the small bowel mesentery (). The appendix was not swelling.\nIn light of the abnormal image findings, it was decided that a surgical intervention should be performed; and a laparoscopic approach was elected. Laparoscopy was performed in supine position with a 5-mm Hasson port at the umbilicus and two 5-mm ports at the right upper and left lower quadrants. Video laparoscopy was performed with a 5-mm 30\u00b0 laparoscope (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). The cecum was initially identified and the entire small bowel was examined. Some serous fluid was observed in the peritoneal cavity. There was an abscess located in the small bowel mesentery right side of the abdomen. Then, the cavity of the abscess was opened attentively and the content was sucked out completely. A piece of peanut was found lying free in the cavity of the abscess (), and the ileal loop and omentum had walled off an inflamed and perforated Meckel's diverticulum (). Diverticulectomy and wedge resection of the ileum were performed. The anastomosis of the ileum was performed intracorporeally.\nHistology confirmed the diagnosis of a perforated Meckel's diverticulitis with abscess formation. Macroscopically, the specimen consisted of one enteric segment measuring 50 mm in length and maximal 20 mm in diameter (). A perforation was found at the tip. On microscopic examination, it showed ulcerative intestinal mucosa with diffusely necrotizing inflammation, with acute and chronic inflammatory cells infiltrating transmurally and fibrinoid substance coating on the serosa. No recognizable ectopic mucosa was identified.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\n72-year-old man (height 163 cm, weight 72 kg) with a 10-year history of diabetes mellitus presented with intermittent intolerable sharp and lancinating pain over the left anterior chest wall and the back for 1 month. He received 300 mg/day of carbamazepine, 300 mg/day of gabapentin, and 1500 mg/day of valacyclovir orally for 7 days following diagnosis with acute herpes zoster at a local private clinic. He reported severe pain in the affected area (a score of 8 or 9 on a visual analog scale where 0 indicated \"no pain\" and 10 indicated \"the strongest pain imaginable\") despite a healed skin rash. A physical examination revealed allodynia and hyperalgesia over the left T2 and T3 dermatomes. The pain relief was maintained for only 3 days through the use of a thoracic epidural block with 10 ml of 0.1% bupivacaine and 10 mg of triamcinolone at the intervertebral space between the T1 and T2 (a visual analog scale pain score of 2 or 3). Simultaneously, the gabapentin and carbamazepine dosages were increased to 900 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, and the antiviral therapy was completed. The patient received 6 subsequent blocks, but each block relieved the pain for only 3 days. He complained about the short-lasting effect of the blocks and the frequent follow up. After reviewing the benefit-risk ratio of the various available forms of therapy, the decision was made to implant a subcutaneous port connected to an epidural catheter for the continuous infusion of opioids and local anesthetics.\nOn arrival in the operating room, the arterial pressure, electrocardiogram, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the patient were monitored, and venous access was secured. The patient was positioned on an operating table in the lateral decubitus position with the patient's side for the port pocket nondependent. His arms were extended at the shoulders and secured in position away from the surgical field. The skin was prepared, and sterile drapes were applied. The radiographic C-arm was then positioned across the thoracic region to provide a cross-table anteroposterior view of the thoracic spine. Using fluoroscopy, the T7-8 interspace, which was thought to be the most appropriate interspace, was identified for the subcutaneous tunneling of an epidural catheter connected to an injection port placed in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An epidural catheter was then inserted through an 18-gauge Tuohy needle using a loss of resistance technique until the tip was at the intervertebral space between the T1 and T2 (). The needle was then withdrawn. An 8 cm transverse incision was made in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and a subcutaneous pocket was created caudad to the incision using a blunt dissection. A tunneling device was then extended within the subcutaneous tissue between the needle insertion site and the pocket. The catheter was then advanced through the tunnel and trimmed to a length that allowed a small loop of catheter to remain deep to the port (Celsite\u00ae, B. Braun, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). The port was connected to the epidural catheter and sutured to the abdominal fascia. Finally, the skin incision was closed. A port needle (Hubsite\u00ae, B. Braun, Ecouen, Germany) with a length appropriate for the thickness of the subcutaneous needle was used to deliver epidural medications: 25 mg of morphine, 200 mg of bupivacaine, and 185 ml of normal saline (a total volume of 250 ml) (). The background infusion rate was 2 ml/hr (no bolus).\nAfter the completion of the procedure, the patient was delivered to the general ward and was observed closely for morphine-induced respiratory depression using pulse oximetry. The other side effects related to the use of epidural morphine and bupivacaine (pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, constipation, systemic toxicity, motor weakness, etc.) were also monitored. Oral bisacodyl (5 mg) and docusate (16.75 mg) were administered daily for constipation prophylaxis. Because no side effects or complications associated with the epidural catheterization, implanted injection port and epidural medications were reported during the 11 days of admission, the patient was discharged and followed up every 10 days to exchange the port needle and epidural infusion pump (Accufuser\u00ae, WooYoung Medical, Seoul, Korea). The epidural infusion and concurrent administration of 900 mg/day gabapentin and 10 mg/day amitriptyline were maintained for 66 days. During treatment, the patient's pain intensity was successfully reduced from 10 (using the visual analog scale) and maintained between 2 and 3. The patient was very satisfied with the treatment. He reported slight hypoesthesia over the left anterior chest and back in the early treatment period. There were no complications associated with the epidural catheters or the medications used. Sixty-six days after the procedure, the subcutaneous port and epidural catheter were removed due to the obstruction of the catheter. He did not complain of pain thereafter but reported a slight numb sensation that remained over the lesion site for 3 months, during which oral gabapentin and amitriptyline were tapered off uneventfully. The patient was thereafter lost to follow up.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.", "output": "### Response:\n27.099", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 24-year-old G4 P3 Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency room with vaginal bleeding at 13 weeks of gestation. On presentation, she reported dizziness, diaphoresis, tremors, anxiety, palpitations, nausea, and leg swelling. Review of system was negative for headache or scotomas. Her vital signs showed blood pressure 141/80 mmHg, heart rate 97 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 per minute, and temperature 98.4\u00b0F. Physical examination was significant for gravid uterus and bilateral lower extremity edema and had fine tremors of both hands. Thyroid gland was normal in size without any nodules. Laboratory studies (Tables and ) revealed suppressed TSH, elevated free T4, and absence of thyroid antibodies including thyrotropin-receptor antibodies (TRAb), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). 24 hour urine protein was 200 mg/day and urine protein/creatinine ratio 0.2 in a random urine specimen. Pelvic ultrasound showed twin gestation with one complete HM and one coexisting normal fetus (Figures \u2013). Based on clinical and biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism with elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels in the absence of autoantibodies, a diagnosis of GTH was made.\nAfter extensive discussion regarding risk of developing complications associated with molar pregnancy [], she preferred to proceed with her current pregnancy until viability of fetus. As she was into her 2nd trimester of pregnancy, she was started on methimazole and the dose was titrated to achieve a goal free T4 in the upper range of normal (normal range = 0.8\u20131.7 ng/dL) to prevent fetal hypothyroidism. She was also on metoprolol 25 mg daily for chronic hypertension which was continued throughout the pregnancy. She also developed preeclampsia at 16 weeks of pregnancy with 24 hr urine protein of 3729 mg/day. She was again recommended termination of pregnancy, but she preferred to proceed with her pregnancy. At 24th weeks of gestation, pregnancy was complicated by worsening preeclampsia and she eventually underwent a lower segment cesarean section with delivery of a viable fetus and evacuation of molar pregnancy. The weight of the baby was 645 gram, and APGAR score was 1 at 1 minute, 2 at 5 minutes, and 3 at 10 minutes. Postoperatively, gross examination of the tissue revealed fragments of pink-red spongy soft tissue without any fetal parts or abnormal Z line, while microscopic examination revealed hydropic villi and trophoblastic proliferation confirming the diagnosis of a complete mole (Figures \u2013). Histopathology of placenta revealed a singleton placenta weighing 156 grams and measuring 13.8 \u00d7 11.3 \u00d7 2.6 cm. At the time of delivery, she was on very low dose of methimazole, and therefore, it was discontinued. She remained clinically and biochemically euthyroid in the postpartum period. Her hCG gradually trended to a normal range of 17 weeks after delivery, and she had spontaneous remission of molar pregnancy as supported by low hCG levels at 1-year follow-up (). The preterm infant did not have any gross abnormalities, and screening for congenital hypothyroidism was negative both at birth with TSH < 2.91 \u03bcU/mL (normal range < 20 \u03bcU/mL) and free T4 8.2 \u03bcg/dL (normal range \u2265 5 \u03bcg/dL) and at two months postdelivery with TSH < 2.91 \u03bcU/mL (normal range < 20 \u03bcU/mL) and free T4 6.7 \u03bcg/dL (normal range \u2265 5\u00b0\u03bcg/dL). Unfortunately, the baby needed mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome and gradually developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and underwent tracheostomy.

According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome secondary to topical steroid use. For adrenal insufficiency, 20 mg/day hydrocortisone treatment was commenced, and for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement. As the patient had high blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia, and large waist circumference (101 cm), he was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, and a low-calorie diet and exercise were advised.

Routine investigations were done. The patient\u2019s complete blood count was within normal limits with a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dl and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 62 mm/first hour. Her white blood cell count was 12 \u00d7 109/L with a differential count of 62.5% neutrophils, 29% lymphocytes, and 6.8% monocytes. Her red blood cell (RBC) count was 3.97 \u00d7 1012/L. Her platelet count was 431 \u00d7 109/L. Routine urine and microscopic examinations showed no features of infection (quantity: sufficient, color: straw, albumin, sugar, and phosphate: nil, pus cells: 4\u20136/high-power field [HPF], epithelial cells: 3\u20134/HPF, RBCs: nil). Further evaluation with ultrasound showed distended endometrial cavity filled with complex fluid (Fig. ) with low-level internal echoes and nonvisualization of the right kidney. A provisional diagnosis of uterus didelphys, hematometra, hematocolpos, and agenesis of the right kidney was made. Pelvic MRI and intravenous urography (IVU) were performed for further evaluation. Pelvic MRI showed two separate endometrial stripes urrounded by endometrium and a muscular layer (Fig. ). The right endometrial cavity and cervix were distended with blood (Figs. and ), possibly owing to obstructed right hemivagina. The right kidney was absent (Fig. ). An MRI finding was suggestive of uterine didelphys with right-sided hematometra resulting from obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral agenesis of the right kidney (HWW syndrome). IVU revealed an absent or nonexcreting right kidney and normal excreting left kidney. Identification and resection of the vaginal septum were done (Fig. ) and reached up to the right cervix for the drainage of tarry blood (Fig. ). Thus vaginal canal was reconstructed (Fig. ). There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. She was discharged 5 days after surgery.\nShe was seen in regular follow-up. She first came for follow-up 7 days after discharge. She was in good health and had no new complaints. Vaginal examination revealed a healthy wound with no adhesion of the vaginal wall. Thus, her recovery was uneventful. Later, she also informed us that she had started regular menstruation without any pain 30 days after the operation. She visited the hospital for another two follow-up visits almost 1 month apart. Her menstrual cycle was normal, and she had no dysmenorrhea or any other complaints.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 59-year-old man (170 cm, 78 kg) had cerebral infarction of the right precentral gyrus 2 years prior presentation and was diagnosed with bilateral ICA stenosis. He was treated conservatively (oral cilostazol and clopidogrel) and followed up; however, the stenosis of the left ICA progressed. Therefore, he was scheduled for CEA. There were no apparent complications related to his previous cerebral infarction. He was receiving an oral treatment for hypertension and dyslipidemia and had a long history of smoking (40 cigarettes per day for 40 years). There were no other notable findings in preoperative examinations. On the day of surgery, he was admitted to the operating room without premedication. Pre-oxygenation was performed using a mask without headband. Anesthesia was induced using 200 \u03bcg fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam, and 60 mg rocuronium was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. A Macintosh laryngoscope was used to expose the larynx. The view was classified as Cormack III. We attempted a tracheal intubation with a endotracheal tube (Shiley\u2122 Endotracheal Tube with TaperGuard\u2122 Cuff 7.5 mm), but the esophagus was inadvertently intubated, so it was removed. The second tracheal intubation by using a Macintosh laryngoscope was successful. Wheals appeared on the upper limbs, neck, and precordium without any vital sign changes after infusion of cefazolin sodium as a preoperative antibiotic, so administration was discontinued. The skin signs were believed to be an allergic reaction to cefazolin, which was changed to fosfomycin, and the patient also received an intravenous infusion containing 200 mg of hydrocortisone sodium phosphate. During surgery, he was placed in the supine position, but the neck was slightly rotated and lateroflexed to the right to secure the surgical field. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.4% sevoflurane and remifentanil at a dose of 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min. Mild hypotension was observed intraoperatively. This was managed with fluid infusions and continuous administration of an appropriate dose of noradrenaline. Surgery was concluded without problems, and the preoperatively observed wheals resolved. Endotracheal aspiration was performed after waking up the patient, but it triggered a strong cough reflex. The patient was then extubated. The duration of surgery was 4 h and 57 min, the duration of anesthesia was 6 h and 29 min, the volume of blood loss was negligible, the in-out balance was + 3210 mL (crystalloid fluid 4175 mL, urine volume 965 mL), and mild swelling of the face and both upper limbs was noted. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a lucid state with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 110 beats/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 3 L of nasal oxygen and respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min. His arterial blood gas analysis was normal, and mild hoarseness was noted without swelling of the neck or stridor. Six hours after admission to the ICU mild bilateral neck swelling appeared. The hoarseness rapidly worsened, and tachypnea and stridor appeared 1 h later without oxygen desaturation. Emergency intubation with a tube (Shiley\u2122 Evac Endotracheal Tube with TaperGuard\u2122 Cuff 7.5 mm) was immediately performed with mild sedation with propofol under spontaneous breathing on suspicion of upper airway obstruction. We used a video laryngoscope (HOYA Co. Ltd., airway scope) with a gum elastic bougie tube introducer. Laryngopharyngeal findings at this time included no epiglottic edema. However, the edema of the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls was present, and it narrowed the oral and pharyngeal cavities. The neck swelling was pronounced, and the neck circumference was 63 cm (Fig. ). A CT scan was performed to investigate the cause and to facilitate differential diagnosis of possible postoperative hemorrhage, but no bleeding was observed. The bilateral parotid and salivary glands were markedly swollen (Fig. ), and the edema of the posterior pharyngeal wall was developed (Fig. ) when compared to the preoperative state. Blood test results revealed a leukocyte count of 8000/\u03bcL (eosinophils 0%), amylase at 1790 U/L, mumps immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 16.6 (+), mumps IgM at 0.27 (\u2212), and C-reactive protein at 0.18. Based on these findings, we concluded that the patient had previously suffered from a mumps infection, but had no active disease. Moreover, he only presented with the clinical features of sialadenitis. We commenced administration of steroids to reduce the edema. On postoperative day (POD) 2, the serum amylase decreased to 457 U/L, gradual improvement of the bilateral parotid gland swelling was observed, and the patient was extubated. The subsequent clinical course was favorable, and the neck swelling disappeared.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 67-year-old male presented with multiple tender erythematous nodules and pustules distributed over his face and upper and lower extremities (). The first skin lesion developed on his left hand about 8 months previously. Despite surgical drainage of his left hand with topical antibiotic treatment at a local hospital, the lesion spread to the face and upper and lower extremities. He complained of general weakness and loss of appetite. Respiratory symptoms such as cough and sputum were not evident. Generalized swelling of the upper and lower extremities was observed.\nThe patient had been employed by a deep-water fishery for more than 30 years. He had been taking oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of diabetes mellitus for 3 years. He had a history of intermittent steroid injections for treatment of arthralgia at the local hospital for the past 6 months. He recalled experiencing multiple minor skin lacerations while working but not sufficiently severe to require medical care.\nOn admission, the patient had a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 68 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and a body temperature of 36.3\u00b0C. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 12,500/mm3, hemoglobin level 11.1 g/dL, platelet count 88,000/mm3, C-reactive protein 30.15 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 32.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, total protein 4.5 g/dL, and albumin 1.7 g/dL. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase were 45 U/L, 18 U/L, 228 U/L and 886 U/L, respectively. The serum concentration of hemoglobin A1c was 11.2%. Needle aspiration from a skin nodule on left wrist was performed for microbiological examination. Intravenous cefazolin was started as an empirical antibiotic.\nOn day 3 since admission, fever was detected, together with aggravation of the skin lesion on the left hand and thrombocytopenia. Two sets of blood cultures were performed, both of which showed no growth. Neutrophilia with a left shift to myelocytes and thrombocytopenia were observed in a peripheral blood smear. On day 5 since admission, pus culture from day 1 revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis; for this reason, cefazolin was changed to vancomycin. His fever persisted and he began exhibiting altered consciousness (Glasgow coma scale 13) with no improvement of the tender multiple nodules. On day 7 since admission, a rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was performed due to the patient\u2019s recent history of steroid injection. The test results showed evidence of adrenal insufficiency. The patient was prescribed an oral hydrocortisone at 40 mg per day. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) with enhancement was performed to identify any other fever foci. Multiple, peribronchial nodules of variable size in both lungs were observed on chest CT (). Other than mild fatty liver, no sign of liver cirrhosis or splenomegaly was evident on abdomen CT. The patient complained of worsening multiple arthralgias in both wrists and ankles. A three-phase bone scan revealed arthritic changes in the right shoulder, both wrists, and the right ankle. The amount of synovial fluid was insufficient for aspiration. Examination of the skin discharge from the left forearm was repeated, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and TB culture, as well as bacterial and fungal culture of sputum were performed. AFB were seen in pus and sputum samples stained with Ziehl\u2013Neelsen. Sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) PCR with hybridization was negative. Skin biopsies from the left cheek and left 2nd finger were performed, and pathologic examination revealed acute suppurative inflammation and a positive Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain. Empirical treatment for both MTB and nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) was initiated with isoniazid (300 mg once per day), rifampin (600 mg once per day), ethambutol (1,200 mg once per day), pyrazinamide (1,500 mg once per day), clarithromycin (500 mg twice per day), and intravenous cefoxitin (3 g three times per day). After 9 days of medication, the fever gradually subsided and the platelet level returned to the normal range; however, painful erythematous nodules remained. CT of the face () and both femurs () showed multiple abscess pockets in the subcutaneous layer where nodules were present. Surgical debridement of the abscess was performed under local anesthesia. NTM grew in culture of two sputum and pus samples. The organism was later identified as M. marinum using NTM-specific DNA probes (hybridization with Geno type mycobacterium CM ver. 1.0\u00ae, Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany). The M. marinum isolate showed resistance to doxycycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. According to the microbiological results, daily medication was changed to clarithromycin (500 mg twice per day), moxifloxacin (400 mg once per day), and ethambutol (1,200 mg once per day). The patient\u2019s symptoms gradually improved and he was discharged on day 39 since admission.\nDuring outpatient follow-up, he continued the medications for 3 months, during which time the skin nodules disappeared and the chest radiological findings improved. However, at 3 months of follow-up, he presented to the emergency center due to an altered mental state. On chest CT, the previous peribronchial nodules were no longer visible and newly developed peribronchial consolidation and perilesional ground glass opacities were seen in the left lung and the posterior basal segment of the right lower lung. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown in blood culture. Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen in urine, respiratory virus, and pneumobacter PCR results were negative.

Furthermore, mild trismus and sublingual edema were noted. Otherwise, physical and neurological examination was unremarkable. She had a sinus tachycardia of 130 b/min, fever 39\u00b0C, and blood pressure 150/90. The chest X-ray on admission was normal.

The patient was urgently transferred to the operating room (OR) where she underwent surgical drainage of the abscess and thereafter admitted to our GICU while sedated, mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically stable, and febrile (38.7\u00b0C). Laboratory tests were noted for extensive leukocytosis (30000 cells\u2216ul). Immediately on ICU admission broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin 400 mg bid and clindamycin 900 mg tid) was initiated.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 55-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital complaining of exertional dyspnea for more than 10 years. She had been developing truncal obesity and facial rounding over the past 2 years, without evidence of acne, hirsutism or wide purple striae. The patient had a family history of hypertension and was diagnosed with hypertension 10 years prior to admission, and she had been using irbesartan, metoprolol and nifedipine XR since then. She was also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and prescribed with statins for 5 years. The patient reported no history of alcohol or drug abuse, in particular, no history of steroid use.\nPhysical examination on admission showed elevated blood pressure (164/104 mmHg) and normal heart rate (74 beats per minute). The patient\u2019s height, body weight and waist circumference were 156 cm, 51 kg and 88 cm, respectively, with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.96 kg/m2. She had a plethoric moon-shaped face, centripetal obesity, buffalo hump, accompanied by ecchymosis and slight edema at both lower limbs. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for slight muscle weakness of the lower-extremities.\nRoutine laboratory examinations showed normal complete blood cell count and hepatorenal parameters, whereas the level of serum triglyceride was slightly elevated. The fasting plasma glucose level was 7.33 mmol/L, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.6% (Table ). Endocrinological examinations showed that circadian rhythm of cortisol disappeared, and the level of ACTH was less than 1.00 ng/L (Table ). Twenty-four-hour urine free cortisol (24 h UFC) elevated to 634.8\u03bcg/24 h (reference range: 20.26-127.55\u03bcg/24 h). The next morning (8 a.m.) serum cortisol level after an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DMST) was 787.5 nmol/L, indicated lack of normal suppression (Table ). The diagnosis of ACTH-independent Cushing\u2019s syndrome was therefore established.\nFor differential diagnosis, aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) was measured after discontinuation of irbesartan and nifedipine XR for at least 2 weeks as they might lead to false-negative result. Plasma and urinary catecholamine concentrations were detected as well. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) was excluded since both plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) were within normal limits along with an ARR value of 2.59 ng/dL: ng/mL.h. Pheochromocytoma was also ruled out based on laboratory findings (Table ).\nThree adrenal nodules were found with adrenal contrast-enhanced CT. One on the right side was 2.5 cm in diameter, and the other two on the left side with diameters of 2.3 cm and 0.6 cm, respectively (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of sellar region revealed normal findings. Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans showed that the T score of lumbar spine, femoral neck and the total hip was \u2212 3.0, \u2212 3.2 and \u2212 3.3, respectively, which indicated osteoporosis. In order to locate the functional lesions in this patient, AVS was performed and the concentrations of plasma aldosterone and cortisol were measured from both adrenal veins (AV) and inferior vena cava (IVC). Adrenal venous catheterization was successful, and the hormone levels were shown in Table . The adrenal vein to inferior vena cava cortisol (AV: IVC) gradient was 13.57 on the right side and 13.88 on the left side. The left and right AV to IVC gradient of aldosterone were 5.58 and 6.79 respectively. Moreover, the cortisol/aldosterone ratio (CAR) in adrenal veins was 292.52 on the right and 359.29 on the left, along with a left-to-right odds ratio of 1.23 (Table ). In combination with the results of AVS, which indicated non-lateralization, this patient was diagnosed with CS induced by bilateral adrenal excessive cortisol secretion.\nThe patient was treated with metoprolol succinate, rosuvastatin, insulin, calcium and vitamin D supplements during the investigation. Considering her poor cardiac function, a two-step operation was planned. Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed, followed by left adrenalectomy after a two-month interval. Pathological findings of the removed right adrenal mass indicated a yellow adenoma with 2.5 cm in diameter, surrounded by atrophic adrenal tissue (Fig. ).\nOvernight 1 mg DMST was repeated 2 weeks after surgery, which demonstrated no inhibition on the serum cortisol at 8 a.m. on the following day, despite significantly decreased cortisol level post-operation (Table ). Therefore, it can be inferred that the autonomous cortisol secretion from left adrenal masses was persistent. The left adrenal gland was then removed and two adenomas were confirmed by pathological examination (Fig. ). The 8 a.m. plasma cortisol after 3 days of bilateral adrenalectomy was 37.30 nmol/L. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy (from 20 mg t.i.d to 20 mg q.d.) was administered after surgery. At 1 year after the operations, the patient lost 4 kg of body weight and the waist circumference reduced to 71 cm. Changes of other laboratory examinations at the last follow-up compared with the first admission were shown in Table .\nAn electronic literature search in PubMed was performed to screen the case reports relating to ACTH-independent Cushing\u2019s syndrome caused by bilateral cortisol-secreting adenomas. Searching words included \u201cCushing\u2019s syndrome\u201d and \u201cbilateral adrenocortical adenoma\u201d. All reference lists from the main reports and relevant reviews were screened manually for additional eligible studies. The results were limited to full-text articles published in English. Extracted data included the first author\u2019s name, year of publication, country, preoperative diagnostic technique, patient characteristics (gender, age at onset and at diagnosis), lesions size, operative method and tumor cut surface.\nA total of 231 papers were identified, of which, 15 available reports were included in the review (Fig. ). The clinical features in these patients were summarized as following: 1) this disorder seemed predominated in females (male: female ratio 1: 14), with an adult onset (the mean age was 39.6 \u00b1 8.6 years; ranged from 24 to 53 years); 2) the size of bilateral adrenal adenomas ranged from 1.0 to 5.0 cm in diameter, the majority of which were solitary in both sides (12 out of 15, 80%); 3) most of the bilateral adrenal lesions were found to occur synchronously, except that three cases occurred at different periods [, ]; 4) the surrounded adrenal cortex of resected adenomas was atrophic in most cases; 5) although no recurrence was reported postoperatively, long-term outcomes remain unclear with the longest follow-up duration of 123 months [] (Table ).\nAll preoperative diagnoses were established based on endocrinological studies and imaging findings, while the methods used to determine the functional lesions were different. Nine patients underwent adrenocortical scintigraphy with different radio-imaging agents, all of which revealed bilateral adrenal uptake. AVS was performed in eight cases to evaluate the hypersecretion of cortisol, and only two of them applied cortisol gradient adjusted by plasma aldosterone [, ]. All patients underwent surgical resection of adenomas, including ten bilateral total adrenalectomy [, \u2013], three unilateral partial adrenalectomy with contralateral total adrenalectomy [, , ], one bilateral partial adrenalectomy [] and one bilateral subtotal adrenalectomy []. All patients received glucocorticoid replacement therapy postoperatively. It is noteworthy that glucocorticoid therapy was reported to be withdrawn during follow-up in patients who underwent bilateral subtotal adrenalectomy or partial adrenalectomy [\u2013].\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

Her past medical history included systemic hypertension for ten years, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nAt the admission she was markedly dyspneic, pale and had a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute. The blood pressure was 125/95 mmHg. At pulmonary auscultation there was evidence of broncospasm without signs of congestion.\nThe lower left leg was warm but pulseless. The oxygen saturation was reduced at about 82-85% in room air. Examination of arterial blood gases revealed hypocapnic hypoxia (pO2 46 mmHg, pCO2 21 mmHg, pH 7.52) and the electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation and inverted T waves in the anterior leads (V1-V3).\nThe laboratory examinations showed significant leukocytosis (21300/mm3), increased blood glucose and serum creatinine levels (Cr. 2.4 mg/dL), with D-dimer levels moderately high (715 ng/ml).\nEchocardiography imaging revealed right ventricular dilatation and elevated transtricuspid systolic gradient with indirect signs of high pulmonary hypertension. The whole-body CT showed a massive thrombus in the main right and left pulmonary artery, extended to lobar branches (). Moreover, the abdomen CT demonstrated the almost entirely occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery () and of the right renal artery, by a floating clot in the lumen, (), resulting in renal hypoperfusion and further worsening of its function (Cr. 3.9 mg/dL). An embolic occlusion of the left external iliac artery was also evident. The Echo Doppler of her lower legs didn\u2019t reveal signs of deep vein thrombosis, showing instead the whole thrombotic occlusion of poplytea artery. There was no evidence of ischemic lesions at the CT scan of brain.\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) excluded the presence of intracardiac thrombi but it revealed a significant interatrial septum\u2019s aneurysm with long tunnel-type patent foramen ovale (PFO). The presence of other anatomic anomalies, frequently associated with patent foramen ovale [], such as Chiari\u2019s Network or a prominent Eustachian Valve were also excluded. A saline contrast echocardiography confirmed the presence of PFO and demonstrated a right-to-left shunt during Valsalva maneuver ().\nBecause of the hemodynamic stability, the patient\u2019s age and the absence of contraindications to thrombolisis, the woman was treated with i.v. tPA (10 mg bolus followed by 90 mg infusion over 2h) and i.v. heparin with progressive improvement of clinical conditions and dyspnea.\nDuring the following days the kidney function gradually improves with a reduction of hematic creatinine from 3.9 to 1.3 mg/dL. A repeat CT one week later showed a partial resolution of pulmonary embolism and the reduction of renal, mesenteric and iliac thrombosis, while the left poplytea artery\u2019s occlusion persisted.\nHer anticoagulation work up showed no evidence of factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation, antiphospholipid antibody screening was negative and level of homocysteine was normal. Levels of protein C, S and antithrombin III were unreliable in the context of an acute thromboembolic event or during antithrombotic therapy. Other predisposing factors for venous thromboembolism as metastatic solid tumors or lymphoproliferative disorders were excluded.\nThe patient was discharged 8 days after admission and no recurrent embolic episode was observed. She has to keep on assuming life-long oral anticoagulant therapy. PFO closure was not performed because our patient required a life-long anticoagulation therapy; the presence of a long tunnel-type PFO may give rise to technical problems in realizing device implantation and finally there are no clear guidelines based on randomized trials for therapy if patent foramen ovale is present.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n11.193", "task": "calc"}

The patient had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism one year earlier and had been prescribed medication since then. No specific abnormal laboratory results were noted on the preoperative evaluation except a first degree AV block on the electrocardiograph.\nMidazolam 2 mg was administered i.m. as premedication 30 minutes before anesthesia. In the operating room, the patient was monitored by an electrocardiogram, a noninvasive blood pressure monitor and pulse oximetry. The baseline blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO2 were within the normal range. Before induction, epidural catheterization was performed at the T6-7 interspace with a paramedian approach for continuous postoperative analgesia. There were no questionable signs suggesting a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum during epidural catheterization. Anesthesia was induced with 100 mg of propofol and 40 \u00b5g of remifentanil. Facial mask ventilation was made easy with 100% O2. After an intravenous injection of 50 mg rocuronium, tracheal intubation was performed using a single lumen internal diameter (ID) 8.0 mm tube (Mallinckrodt medical. high volume low pressure. Athlone. Ireland) in one attempt without difficulty. The laryngeal grade was 1 and the tracheal tube was passed through trachea without resistance. The tube was fixed 23 cm from the level of the incisors and the cuff was inflated with 4 ml of air as a minimal volume to prevent a circle leak in this patient. Bilateral breath sounds were confirmed by auscultation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in air/O2 (FiO2 = 0.5) and supplemental continuous infusion of remifentanil. A nasogastric decompressive tube was not inserted into this patient. No other venous access including central venous line was made. The subtotal gastrectomy with gastroduodenostomy (Billoth I) under the diaphragm proceeded without an event. At the end of surgery, all anesthetic agents were discontinued and the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with pyridostigmine and glycopyrrolate. The tracheal tube was removed when the patient responded to verbal commands and showed sufficient spontaneous respiration and neuromuscular function (as ascertained by the nerve stimulator). There were no tinged signs of blood or tissue-like material on the removed tube. The patient remained in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) for 30 minutes event free and was then transferred to the general ward. During the 24 hour postoperative period, the patient's vital signs were stable without any specific incidents. On postoperative day 1, the patient complained of discomfort on the left lateral side of the neck without any dysphagia or dyspnea. On palpation, diffuse crepitus was felt on that site of the neck but no definite swelling was detected. Pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 91% under room air breathing. Oxygen with a flow rate of 3 L/min was provided through a nasal cannula. The patient had already been placed on nil orally and intravenous antibiotics administration due to surgery. Arterial gas analysis before applying the oxygen showed the following: pH 7.44, PaO2 74.4 mmHg, PaCO2 34.2 mmHg and 95.8% of SaO2. Neck CT (), chest CT () and chest x-ray revealed emphysema of the left neck (), a retropharyngeal space and a pneumomediastinum. The patient was observed closely with an electrocardiograph and pulse oximetry. The patient showed no specific signs or symptoms over the subsequent 24 hours, and the oxygen saturation was maintained at 99-100%. Antibiotics were used for only two days, and a diet was also started. On postoperative day 6, the emphysema of the neck and retraopharynx had almost resolved, but a small amount of air still remained in the mediastinum (). He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 8. Five days after discharge, the neck AP/lateral x-ray still showed slight emphysematous signs.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 29-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath and productive cough consisting of green phlegm. The symptoms started a month prior for which she visited her primary medical doctor and was treated for pneumonia. Her symptoms continued to persist and gradually worsen at which point she was also treated with tamiflu for influenza. Her other symptoms however continued to progress and consisted of fever, chills, cough, body aches, and shortness of breath. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and works in a pharmacy.\nOn physical examination, the patient was tachycardia with a heart rate of 118, blood pressure of 111/72, respiratory rate of 24, and was saturating 88% on room air. At the time, she was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 \u00b0F. Significant findings on examination showed diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with crackles on lung examination. Laboratory data demonstrated hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 39, white blood cell of 10.9, and platelets of 344,000. Sodium was 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 1.0, and glucose of 113. Troponins were negative. D-dimer was elevated at 0.71 and CT angiogram (CTA) was conducted to rule out pulmonary embolism. CTA of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed tree-in bud changes in the right upper lobe suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process (). Similar findings were also seen in the right lower lobe. There were linear changes in the lower lobes bilaterally which most likely represented atelectasis and there was a 7.6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\nThe patient was admitted to telemetry for the management of pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone initially. Patient was found to be positive for Mycoplasma pneumonia and medications were adjusted accordingly. Patient continued to have persistent hypoxia and continued to desaturate to 88% upon ambulation. She was later found to have hemophilus influenza growth in sputum culture, which was properly being managed by her antibiotic regimen. During her hospital stay, although the patient was receiving solumedrol and antibiotics she continued to have diffuse bilateral crackles and productive cough. Patient was found to have leukocytosis as high as 19.6, but this could be attributed to her steroid treatment. However, this train of thought remained unclear as the patient was also found to have a bandemia of 21. Her antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were adjusted to consist of doxycycline, zyvox, and fluconazole. The patient continued to deteriorate and systemic workup including allergy test, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (cANCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), purified protein derivative (PPD), QuantiFERON, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was all conducted. Full systemic workup returned negative for any findings. After completing her course of antibiotics, she was also removed from her steroids but would continue to desaturate and lung findings remained unchanged. Patient underwent bronchoscopy but no significant mass or lesion was found to biopsy and her postoperative diagnosis remained as non-resolving pneumonia. Repeat CT scan was performed which showed minimal improvement and continue to suggest pneumonia and possibly underlying interstitial lung disease ().\nThe patient was scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with biopsy of the right middle and lower lobes. Right lower lobe wedge biopsy on pathology showed lung parenchyma with consolidation, atelectasis, and areas of fibrosis (). Right mid lung biopsy also showed foci of consolidation but also consisted of varying stages of questionable emphysema (). As the findings were highly unusual and emphysematous changes were not found on patient\u2019s CT scans, the pathology was sent to a specialist, who confirmed the results but again noted them to be very non-specific. The patient\u2019s post-operative status was complicated and patient desaturated overnight and required intubation. Alpha-1 antitrypsin was sent but returned elevated. The patient was successfully extubated after 2 days. She was placed back on steroids and was clinically improving over the course of another 1 week. Her pulse oximetry however on room air remained around 86% even after a week of steroids and thus the patient would be discharged on home oxygen therapy. Pulmonary function tests were significant for a forced vital capacity (FVC) moderately reduced at 1.65 L (60%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) severely reduced at 0.98 L (40%), FEV1/FVC ratio reduced at 59%, and MVV severely reduced at 28%. Flow volume loop demonstrated a combined obstructive and restrictive contour (). Lung volumes showed a vital capacity reduced at 1.65 L (60%), total lung capacity (TLC) reduced at 2.08 L (56%), and residual volume (RV) reduced at 0.43 L (43%). Her diffusion capacity (DLCO) was also severely reduced at 38%. These findings were suggestive of combined severe, irreversible obstructive and restrictive lung disease with severely reduced diffusion capacity. She would follow up with infectious disease and a pulmonary specialist as an outpatient for further workup and repeat CT scan in 3 weeks with further discussion with regard to possible lung transplant options.\n\nWhat is the patient's CURB-65 score?", "output": "### Response:\n0", "task": "calc"}

In autoimmune study antinuclear antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, and anti-liver-kidney-microsomal antibodies were negative. Serial laboratory investigations are mentioned in Table . Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild uniform enlargement of the liver with normal echo-texture, there was no evidence of biliary obstruction and portal hypertension. Microscopic examination of the liver biopsy showed diffuse fatty changes and steatosis. Bile pigment in hepatocytes and bile in bile canaliculi was present. The mild proliferation of the bile duct and mild inflammation of the portal triad were also present.\nClinical history of the patient and laboratory parameters with a prior history of dapsone therapy was consistent with a diagnosis of DHS with leukemoid reaction and thrombocytosis.

There was no history of trauma, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, dysuria, hematuria or melena. His past medical history included hypertension, atrial flutter and cardiomyopathy, and he had an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD). There was no prior history of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the patient or in his family. His past surgical history included an inguinal hernia repair. His medications included aspirin, valsartan, metoprolol and atorvastatin. He did not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.\nPhysical exam showed vitals signs as follows: body temperature of 36.3\u00b0C, blood pressure of 140/82 mmHg, heart rate of 52 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and pulsoximetry of 98% on room air. He was alert, but appeared in mild distress due to pain. His abdominal exam revealed tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound, guarding, distention or organomegaly. The remainder of the exam was normal.\nThe initial emergency department evaluation included an electrocardiogram that showed atrial flutter with a 4:1 block. Laboratory assessment revealed trace hematuria, no leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal range, 0.7\u20131.4 mg/dL), mildly elevated lipase to 85 U/L (normal range, 12\u201370 U/L), mild hyperglycemia and mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase to 46 U/L (normal range, 7\u201340 U/L). The lactate and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase was not ordered at presentation, but obtained 2 days after admission, and was elevated at 1,479 U/L (normal range, 100\u2013220 U/L). Lactate dehydrogenase is present in the renal tissue and elevates in serum after kidney insult, and it is unknown whether this level correlates to the severity of the infarct.\nGiven the nature of the pain and the hematuria seen on urinalysis and the history of cardiomyopathy with atrial flutter, both nephrolithiasis and mesenteric ischemia were strongly considered as causes for this acute pain. Therefore, both non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography (CT) images [Figures and ] were obtained, which showed extensive infarction involving the upper pole of the right kidney with multiple patchy infarcts into the lower pole, a patent right renal artery, but no visualization of the interparenchymal arterial branches within the mid and upper poles of the right kidney, suggesting arterial thromboembolic disease. There was poor opacification of the right renal vein, and, therefore, renal vein thrombus could not be ruled out. A 2-mm left renal calculus was also identified.\nThe urology and vascular surgery services were consulted, and both recommended conservative treatment with anticoagulation. In addition to normal saline and dilaudid for pain control, a heparin bolus of 80 mg/kg was given and an infusion at 18 mg/kg/h was initiated, with the patient being admitted to the general medicine service.\nIt was concluded his renal artery thrombosis was most likely embolic and a 2-D echocardiogram was ordered, which showed no intramural thrombus. He was discharged 5 days later, on coumadin. His creatinine, which was 1.3 mg/dL on admission, rose to 1.8 mg/dL and fell to 1.7 mg/dL by discharge.

One hundred healthy Chinese volunteers (200 chromosomes) were included as controls. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study.\nGenomic DNA was extracted by salting out from peripheral white blood cells. The entire coding region and adjacent intronic segments of SLC5A2 were screened for mutations by the direct sequencing of PCR products. The genomic DNA reference sequences of SLC5A2 (NG_012892.1, Gene ID: 6524, MIM: 182381, GEO Profiles ID: 62739973 and 65974292) and protein reference sequences of SGLT2 (NP_003032, UniProtKB - P31639) were acquired from the Entrez gene and protein database, respectively. To exclude the possibility that the identified mutations represented common polymorphisms, control chromosomes were tested by PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism. A novel missense SLC5A2 mutation was found in the patient (c.1891G > A/p.E631K, Fig. ). The amino acid residue (631E) was found to be highly conserved among human SGLT subtypes and across SGLT2 homologs in multiple species. The mutation was not detected in any of the control 200 chromosomes, indicating that it does not represent a common polymorphism.\nHuman SGLT2 cDNA from normal kidney, generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Wild-type and c.1891A mutagenized SLC5A2 generated by site-directed mutagenesis were subcloned into the PEXL-GFP vector [], and verified by sequencing. Human HEK293 cells (obtained from central laboratories of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and originally from the American Type Culture Collection) were seeded into 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. Plasmid constructs (0.5 \u03bcg) were transfected into cultured cells at 70\u201380 % confluency using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After 24 h of incubation, expression of SGLT2 wild type\u2013GFP and mutant\u2013GFP fusion proteins was detected by western blotting, confocal laser microscopy, and transport assays as we have done in previous studies [, ].\nWestern blotting analysis (Fig. ) demonstrated that 631 K SGLT2 expression was significantly lower than that of wild-type SGLT2\u2013GFP (0.24 \u00b1 0.14 vs. 1, P = 0.002, n = 4, Fig. ). Confocal imaging revealed that both the wild-type and mutant fusion proteins were expressed in a punctate pattern in the cell membrane, which merged well with the cell membrane marker 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2019,3\u2019-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC18(3), Fig. ).\nThe function of wild-type SGLT2\u2013GFP and 631 K SGLT2\u2013GFP fusion proteins in cultured HEK293 cells was confirmed by transport of the glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3- diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), evaluated by fluorescence intensity using flow cytometry. 2-NBDG uptake in HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type SGLT2\u2013GFP was increased about 3.5-fold compared with those transfected with GFP-only control vector (7926 \u00b1 1153 vs. 2314 \u00b1 791, P < 0.001, n = 4, Fig. ). The uptake activity of the mutant SGLT2 631 K-GFP fusion protein was significantly decreased compared with wild-type SGLT2\u2013GFP (3629 \u00b1 1082 vs. 7926 \u00b1 1153, P < 0.001, n = 4, Fig. ).\nThe Medical Ethics Committee of the Inner Mongolia People\u2019s Hospital and Peking University approved the protocol. Data were compared with the t-test or analysis of variance followed by Fisher\u2019s least significant difference methods for multiple comparisons. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD, and significant differences were declared at P < 0.05.\nKidney proximal tubules reabsorb almost 180 g glucose daily, which is filtered through the glomeruli. SGLT2 accounts for most glucose reabsorption. It is responsible for the active transport of glucose across the brush border membrane, and is expressed almost exclusively in the kidney []. Recent studies have reported that SLC5A2 mutations are causative of FRG [, , \u2013]. The long-term outcome of FRG patients is excellent, so SGLT2 inhibitors have been the subject of particular attention for the treatment of diabetes [, ]. Although research into FRG may help with a breakthrough for diabetes treatment, expression and functional studies of SLC5A2 mutations in FRG are rare, and the role of SGLT2 C-terminal mutations needs further clarification.\nA previous study [] suggested that overt glucosuria requires the individual to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for SLC5A2 mutations. Consistent with this, our patient with a heterozygous mutation had \u201cmild\u201d glucosuria (urine glucose excretion, 7.56 g/day). However, our findings still imply that the mutation causes a clinically relevant SGLT2 dysfunction. Our in vitro study of 293 cells showed that the transport activity of the mutant SGLT2 631 K-GFP fusion proteins was significantly lower than that of wild-type. SLC5A2 mutations may reduce or abolish transporter activity by impairing protein synthesis, processing, or insertion into the plasma membrane. Furthermore, transporter activity may be reduced or abolished by accelerating protein removal or degradation, altering functional regulation, or impairing intrinsic activity. The mutant SGLT2 631 K\u2013GFP in our study had a similar punctate membrane expression pattern to wild-type, but a decreased expression intensity. Thus, the mutation (c.1891G > A/p.E631K) is likely to impair protein synthesis or accelerate protein removal or degradation. Our results also suggest that the SGLT2 C-terminal is very important for protein expression levels. We speculate that the reduced expression of the SGLT2 mutant is responsible for the decreased transport activity of mutant SGLT2.\nAlthough it was not possible to perform a family study in the present case, identification of mutations that cause glucosuria will enable the establishment of a genotypic FRG diagnosis, providing important information for families and physicians. In general, renal biopsies are unnecessary for FRG patients, so the effect of the 631 K mutation on SGLT2 expression in the kidney is still unknown. We were restricted to an in vitro study of the expression and function of SGLT2 using GFP as a fluorescent label because we previously found that the SGLT2 antibody was unsuited to use in 293 cells, COS-7 cells, and Xenopus laevis oocytes.\n\nWhat is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation. She had a pacemaker inserted at another facility 2 weeks before. No perioperative complications were reported and patient had been doing well without any complaints till the day of presentation. Medications included dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation. On examination, the patient was diaphoretic but in no respiratory distress. Temperature was 97\u00b0F, pulse 96/minute, irregular; systolic blood pressure was 70 mm Hg; respiratory rate was 22/minute; and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. No jugular venous distension was noted. Cardiac examination revealed irregular rhythm, no murmur or rub. Lung auscultation revealed slightly diminished breath sounds at left base. Chest X-ray showed a mild-to-moderate left-sided pleural effusion; pacemaker leads appeared to be in the right ventricle (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed trioventricular (AV) sequential pacing (). Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed no wall motion abnormality with normal ejection fraction. Pacemaker leads were visualized in the right ventricle (RV) on ECHO. Her hemoglobin was 8 gm%; prothrombin time (PT) was 19 seconds; and INR was 2.9.\nNo pacing or sensing failure was noted on device interrogation. The patient's hypotension persisted despite vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation including transfusion of 2 units of blood cell and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and improvement in her hemoglobin to 11 gm%. A computed tomogram (CT) of the chest was performed which showed a moderate left pleural effusion, with the pacemaker wire extending to the left pleural cavity and a small localized pericardial effusion adjoining the pleural effusion (). The patient's hemodynamic instability was not due to tamponade effect as the pericardial effusion was small but due to continued hemorrhage into the pleural cavity due to her coagulopathic state from being on dabigatran for her atrial fibrillation, which was not fully corrected by fresh frozen plasma infusion.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a median sternotomy. The pacemaker lead was found to be protruding out of the right ventricle (). The external portion was cut with the remaining intracardiac portion of the pacemaker lead left in place. The perforation of the RV wall was repaired. The hemothorax and hemopericardium were evacuated. Subsequently, the patient's hemodynamic status improved. Two days later, the remaining portion of the pacemaker lead was removed transvenously. A new pacemaker was inserted transvenously and placed on the right ventricular septum.

The patient\u2019s ferritin level was 5644 ng/ mL, and her fibrinogen level was 147 mg/dL, despite fresh frozen plasma treatment. During this period the patient was given an anti-oxidant cocktail that included selenium, n- acetylcysteine, vitamin E, and desferrioxamine due to the possibility of hemochromatosis, but there was no improvement in clinical or laboratory parameters. For the differential diagnosis of neonatal hemochromatosis buccal biopsy was performed, but no evidence of hemochromatosis was observed.\nOn d 12 of hospitalization hepatosplenomegaly was noted on physical examination and the patient\u2019s WBC count, Hb, and Plt count decreased to 3.8 x 109/L, 6.5 g/ dL, and 48 x 109/L, respectively. Hemophagocytosis was observed in her bone marrow aspirate () and CRP increased to 19 mg/dL. The patient was diagnosed as HLH based on fulfillment of 6 diagnostic criteria (fever, hemophagocytosis, hypofibrinogenemia, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and hyperferritinemia). Antibiotic treatment was changed to imipenem due to suspected sepsis, and then vancomycin was added. Blood cultures were negative and the patient was given high-dose (1 mg/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to stop the inflammatory cascade, because diverse bacterial infections were suspected to have caused HLH.

He was drowsy without nausea or vomiting. Glasgow coma scale score was 15. Blood routine showed that white blood cell count was 15.63 \u00d7 109/L. Thoracic computerized tomography which was taken a day before the surgery revealed bullae and low attenuation area in bilateral lower lobes []. Written consent of publishing of this paper was obtained from the patient when he was discharged.\nThe patient was positioned supine in the operating room. Anesthesia was managed with etomidate, fentanyl, propofol, remifentanil, and cisatracurium. After successful intubation on one attempt, chest auscultation revealed bilateral equal breath sounds without rales or wheezing. Vital volume was set at 450 mL and respiratory rate 12 bpm without positive end-expiratory pressure. The central vein was not punctured or catheterized. During surgery, the artery aneurysm was clipped with Sugita Titanium Aneurysm Clip (17-001-86, MIZUHO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The surgery lasted for 3 h and finished uneventfully without awakening the patient during the surgery. There was no blood transfusion. A total of 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution was given. Urine output was 300 mL.\nThe spontaneous breath was back 10 min after the surgery, so mechanical ventilation was stopped. Twenty min later, the patient developed a sudden dry cough without consciousness or extubation. Soon after the cough, oxygen saturation began to decline, so assisted ventilation was intermittently used to keep oxygen saturation more than 90%. In the meantime, subcutaneous emphysema was noted over his neck and chest. His blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm. A bolus of 50 mg propofol was given intravenously. Diminished breath sounds were detected in the left lung on auscultation. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate began to decrease. A thoracic surgeon was invited for consultation immediately and arrived 10 min later. After physical examination, needle aspiration was performed under local anesthesia in the left midaxillary line and in the fifth intercostal space, and then a large of tensioned air was immediately released, so tube thoracostomy was undergone at the same site. The procedures were followed by immediate improvement in oxygen saturation. During the whole period, heart rate was once decreased to 40 bpm, so a total of 1 mg atropine was administered intravenously and blood pressure was reduced to 70/40 mmHg, so 10 mg dopamine was given. No tear of the trachea or endotracheal tube obstruction was found under fiberoptic bronchoscopy. When his status was stable, the patient was taken to take cerebral and thoracic computerized tomography scan with oxygen supplementation. The thoracic computerized tomography demonstrated bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and chest [].

She had experienced exacerbations of congestive heart failure for the previous 20 years and had a permanent cardiac pacemaker that had also been initially inserted about 20 years earlier due to sick sinus syndrome with atrial fibrillation. She also had dementia, and a history of multiple incidents of cerebral infarction and its complications.\nAt the emergency department, her blood pressure was 112/72 mmHg, pulse rate was 101/min with an irregular rhythm, and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. On examination, she appeared tachypneic (respiratory rate, 28/min) and her breathing sounds were reduced over the left lung field. The arterial oxygen saturation in room air was 92%. The other laboratory findings were not notable. Chest radiography revealed opacification of the whole left lung field, thought by a physician of the emergency department to be unilateral pleural effusion (). Therefore, after local anesthesia and under sterile conditions, a 16F catheter (Prime-S; Sungwon Medical, Cheongju, Korea) was inserted into the 6th left intercostal space in the anterior axillary line without image guidance.\nShortly after insertion, blood was draining in a pulsatile way from the catheter. However, she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg and a heart rate of 98/min. After clamping the catheter, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed () and showed that severe cardiomegaly with displacement of the heart to the left with atelectasis (originally thought to be massive pleural effusion). The catheter had been inserted anterolaterally into the sixth intercostal space on the left and was within the left ventricle, exiting the ventricle through the aortic valve with the tip of the catheter located in the ascending aorta. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild aortic regurgitation with a small amount of pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance.\nOpen mini-thoracotomy with chest tube insertion was performed under general anesthesia the next day. The previous catheter was carefully pulled out without myocardial repair. Although the removal of the catheter was successful and well tolerated by the patient, the hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and long-term mechanical ventilation.

He has no symptoms and signs of systemic vasculitis such as rashes, joint pains or mucosal surface ulcers. He was diagnosed of bipolar mood disorder in 2008, and was treated with oral quetiapine fumarate 100 mg daily. His bipolar mood disorder responded well to quetiapine fumarate without any side effects. Sexual history was not significant and he has no history of substance abuse or smoking. There was no family history of vascular events as well.\nHe was a medium built individual with a body mass index of 24.83 kg/m2 (height 165.5 cm, body weight 68 kg). His body weight prior to quetiapine treatment was 62 kg. Blood pressure was 122/74 mmHg with a regular pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. The visual acuity of his left eye was 0.33, with near visual acuity of N24 at 33 cm. The right eye had visual acuity of 1.0 and near vision of N6 at 33 cm. Confrontation test revealed a left central scotoma. Relative afferent pupillary defect was absent. Anterior segment examination for both eyes was normal. The intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg bilaterally.\nPosterior segment examination of the left eye revealed flame-shaped retinal haemorrhages along an arcuate course, corresponding to the supero-temporal retinal nerve fibre layer. Macular oedema involved the fovea and was associated with partial macular star due to hard exudates deposition. Intraretinal pigmentary spots with adjacent typical red blot hemorrhages believed to be resolving blot hemorrhages were seen. The patient has never had any laser treatment before. The supero-temporal retinal vein was dilated and tortuous along its entire course (Figure ). The arterio-venous ratio was 2:3 infero-temporally but was 1:3 supero-temporally. There were increased arteriole reflexes with arterovenous nicking which was confined only to the supero-temporal retinal artery of the left eye. The optic disc was pink with well-defined margin and cup-disc ratio of 0.5. There was another area of flame-shaped retinal haemorrhages, two-disc diameter temporal to the fovea. The retinal haemorrhages were oriented along the distal infero-temporal retinal nerve fiber layer but did not begin at the retinal artery-vein intersection. The infero-temporal retinal vein was neither dilated nor tortuous (Figure ). There were no cotton wool spots, the vitreous was clear, and there was no evidence of retinal periarteritis or periphlebitis. Posterior segment findings of the right eye were not significant (Figure ).\nOptical coherence tomography (Heidelberg Spectralis \u00ae Tracking Laser Tomography) revealed the thickness of the superior half of the fovea was increased, with central serous neurosensory retinal detachment (Figure ). Full blood count, renal profile, liver function test and thyroid function test were all normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 3 mm/hour, C-reactive protein was 0.05 mg/dl. Connective tissue screening test (antinuclear antibodies, anti double-stranded DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus were all negative. Fasting blood sugar was 4.7 mmol/L. However, annual lipid profile showed progressive derangement. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels showed an increasing trend. While the HDL-choleterol levels were progressing in the opposite direction (Table ). Chest radiography was normal.\nThe patient was diagnosed to have left major superior temporal branch retinal vein occlusion complicated by macula oedema. The cause of the RVO was attributed to dyslipidaemia secondary to quetiapine fumarate. The condition was conveyed to his psychiatrist, and he was subsequently referred to the internist for the management of his dyslipidaemia. The patient was treated with oral lovastatin 20 mg daily. His lipid profile normalized after 2 months but the final visual acuity remained 0.33 and near visual acuity N24 at 33 cm due to the presence of hard exudates at the fovea.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n64.318", "task": "calc"}

Laboratory findings revealed renal failure (blood urea nitrogen 137 mg/dL, serum creatinine 20.5 mg/dL) and anemia (hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL) and metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas analysis (pH 7.3, bicarbonate 16.4 mEq/L). Routine urinalysis revealed no proteinuria or hematuria. Complement levels were normal range and autoantibodies (Antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) were negative. Chest PA showed no cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema, and Kidney-Ureter-Bladder radiography (KUB) was non-specific. Kidney ultrasonography revealed diffusely increased echogenicity and kidney size was smaller than normal (8.2 \u00d7 5.0 cm). The abdominal computed tomography showed no evidence of stone in both kidneys ().\nDue to uremic symptoms, emergency hemodialysis was started and the kidney biopsy was performed to identify the cause of ESRD. The kidney biopsy showed foci of tubular damage with deposition of translucent crystals of different shapes which are predominantly intraluminal, and confirmed these crystals as calcium oxalate crystals using polarized light (). Final report of pathology was chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystal deposits and a change of ESRD.\nHe was an office worker. He received regular national health examination including renal function and urinalysis, and both results were normal until two years before admission. His height and body weight were 167 cm and 70 kg. Body mass index was 25 kg/m2. Review of medical history revealed no history of kidney stone, diabetes, hypertension and operation. He had no medical family history. From the drug history, he had taken Chaga mushroom powder for 5 years due to atopic dermatitis. Initially, he had taken 3 g daily for 4 years following company's recommendation and 9 g of powder for another year because his symptom did not improve.\nBased on pathologic finding (oxalate nephropathy) and drug history (long-term exposure to Chaga mushroom), we suspected the association between Chaga mushroom and oxalate nephropathy in our case. Thus, we requested oxalate content of remained Chaga mushroom to researcher/clinical pharmacology division of Catholic Medical center clinical research coordinating center of Korea. Measurement of oxalate was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analysis revealed extremely high content of oxalate in Chaga mushroom powder (0.14 g of oxalate per 1 g of Chaga mushroom powder).\nWe finally diagnosed this case as Chaga mushroom-induced oxalate nephropathy with kidney biopsy findings, drug history and high content of oxalate. Clinical course of our case was unfavorable. Renal function has not recovered and he is on maintenance hemodialysis for 18 months.\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Korea (IRB No. 2019-3713-0001) and an informed consent was received from the patient and a caregiver.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 17-year-old adolescent boy with Jeune syndrome underwent spinal correction. He was born abroad and immigrated to Japan when he was 5 months old. He survived infancy, although he was diagnosed with Jeune syndrome as the cause of thoracic deformity, renal dysfunction, and urinary tract abnormality at 11 months old at a university hospital. His renal condition became worse with age. He underwent a renal transplant to treat chronic renal failure at 10 years old. Although it was not clear when his spinal deformity was discovered, he had received no treatment until after he entered junior high school. He was treated with a brace at 14 years old. However, he disliked the brace and discontinued using it within a few months. His spinal deformity progressed and he was referred to our university hospital to treat scoliosis at the age of 16 years. He did not have any restriction of daily life at that time, but was worried about his trunk deformity.\nHe was 160 cm (\u22121.9 SD), 50 kg, and thus his body mass index (BMI) was 18.5 kg/m2. Physical findings were imbalance of his shoulder and waist lines, a prominent right scapula and rib hump, and left lumbar hump (Fig. ). He did not have obvious short stature or a small chest. We could not find any other abnormalities except for hypacusia. He had a scar in the center of his abdomen that was made when he received the renal transplant. The result of arterial blood gas analysis was almost normal and respiratory functional data showed moderately restrictive impairment of ventilation (vital capacity (VC) 2.25 L, %VC 54.4 %, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 100 % predicted). A peripheral blood sample was obtained and all laboratory data were normal including renal function.\nHis total spine radiograph showed double major curves when we first saw him. The posterior\u2013anterior total spine radiograph showed a coronal Cobb angle of 70\u00b0 (T4\u2013L2), 82\u00b0 (T12\u2013L3), and Risser grade V. A lateral total spine radiograph showed an 81\u00b0 thoracolumbar kyphosis (T9\u2013L3) and 10\u00b0 thoracic lordosis (T5\u2013L2) (Fig. ). We considered that he had indications for surgical treatment. We classified his spinal deformity as Lenke type 6C [] and planned the fusion area and surgical strategy. The risks and benefits of spinal correction were explained and informed consent was obtained from the patient and his family.\nSufficient attention was paid to avoid compressing his transplanted kidney, which was placed around the right lower abdomen and to maintain sufficient flow though the kidney when he was fixed in a prone position. The fusion area was from T4 to L4, using pedicle screws, hooks, and sublaminar wirings as anchors. Ponte osteotomy was added from T12 to L2 to correct the kyphotic deformity. Before wound closing, autogenous bone grafting was performed. There were no intraoperative complications associated with respiratory dysfunction or the transplanted kidney. Cobb angles were corrected by 49 % to 36\u00b0 (T4\u2013T12) and 42\u00b0 (T12\u2013L3), respectively. Thoracolumbar kyphosis was corrected by 63 % to 30\u00b0 (T9\u2013L3).\nOur patient could be extubated immediately after wound closure and did not need to be treated at an intensive care unit (ICU). Oxygen supply was administered routinely for a single overnight period and respiratory dysfunction was not identified in the postoperative period. Sufficient perfusion ensured no circulatory failure of the transplanted kidney occurred. He was discharged 25 days postoperatively. His most recent radiographs at 2 years after surgery showed Cobb angles of 40\u00b0 (T4\u201312), and 42\u00b0 (T12\u2013L3), and correction losses were 4\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 respectively. A lateral whole spine radiograph also showed thoracic lordosis was 5\u00b0 and thoracolumbar kyphosis was 28\u00b0 (Fig. ). A respiratory function test was performed at one year after surgery, showing VC 2.47 L, %VC 55.7 %, and FEV1 95.9 %.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 31-year-old woman (G1, P0) had been diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease at 16 years of age. She discontinued treatment at her own discretion but was advised to resume treatment when she expressed her desire to become pregnant. At the time treatment had resumed, her TRAb (second generation) level was 211 IU/L (normal range: < 1.75 IU/L). Her family history was negative.\nThe patient became pregnant naturally, at a time when her thyroid function was not satisfactorily controlled by a high dose of propylthiouracil (PTU). An alternative treatment (isotope therapy or surgery) was being considered. Because of hyperemesis gravidarum, oral medications were no longer an option, resulting in her thyroid function deteriorating during week 13 of her pregnancy. Her TRAb level was 43.6 IU/L at that time, and a daily dose of 50 mg potassium iodide (KI) was administered. As a result, her thyroid function was under control, and KI administration was discontinued at week 17. The patient\u2019s FT3 level fluctuated between normal and elevated, whereas her FT4 and TSH levels were low. Her TRAb level gradually declined but was still high at week 33 (18.4 IU/L).\nAt 33 weeks and 5 days of gestation, the amniotic pocket and the cervical lengths were 8.1 and 2.6 cm, respectively, indicating worsening hydramnios and threatened premature labor. A blood test showed that the patient\u2019s TSH level had increased to within the normal range. Because pre-pregnancy reduction in her antithyroid medication caused sudden worsening of her thyroid function, she was prescribed a daily supplementary course of 25 \u03bcg levothyroxine. At 34 weeks of gestation, she was admitted for hydramnios management and prevention of threatened premature labor.\nOn admission, blood sampling showed an increased TSH level; thus, her thyroid function had improved. Because she was experiencing frequent uterine contractions, we consulted the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology at our hospital and initiated a continuous drip of ritodrine hydrochloride under careful monitoring for aggravation of hyperthyroidism. At 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation, a transabdominal ultrasound indicated enlargement of the fetal thyroid. It showed a transverse diameter and circumference of 58.4 and 178 mm, respectively (mean values at the 35th week of pregnancy: 18.9 mm and 51.1 mm respectively []) (Fig. a). The blood flow was diffusely increased (Fig. b), and hydramnios was observed. In addition, the epiphyseal nucleus of the distal femur could not be confirmed. The fetus was in face presentation (Fig. a). We assumed that the cause of the hydramnios was the inability to swallow the amniotic fluid due to the size of the thyroid. We suspected that the PTU had crossed the placenta and migrated to the fetus, causing fetal goiter; therefore, we initiated a reduced dose of antithyroid medication for the mother at 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation. After reducing the PTU dose from 200 to 100 mg/day, neither the mother nor the fetus showed signs of hyperthyroidism. The dose of PTU was gradually reduced to 50 mg/day, while the levothyroxine dose was increased to 100 \u03bcg/day. The fetal thyroid showed a shrinking tendency, as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at 36 weeks and 3 days of gestation showed a 3-cm fetal thyroid transverse diameter (transverse section; Fig. b). The next day, an ultrasound indicated that the AFI had decreased from 24 to 15 cm, and that the fetus\u2019 thyroid blood flow had returned to normal (restricted to the thyroid margins). The fetus had moved into a normal flexion position.\nBecause of the goiter, we were unable to confirm that there would be a patent airway after delivery. Therefore, we speculated that a tracheotomy would be necessary. After consultation with both the Department of Neonatal Medicine and the Department of Pediatric Surgery, an elective cesarean delivery was performed at 36 weeks and 5 days of gestation. On day 7 after delivery, the mother showed signs of hyperthyroidism, which necessitated an increase in her PTU dose.\nA diagram describing the therapeutic course from pre-pregnancy to postpartum is shown in Fig. .\nThe infant was a male, weighing 2817 g, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. His umbilical aortic blood pH was 7.26. The anterior cervical region had a transverse diameter of 40 mm, indicating an enlarged thyroid gland (Fig. ). Crying was normal, and no resuscitation was necessary. The infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth because of premature delivery and goiter. No bradycardia was observed, and other than the goiter, no external deformities that would suggest congenital hypothyroidism, such as megaloglossia or umbilical hernia, were observed.\nA sonography indicated that the thyroid gland had a left-to-right transverse diameter of 41.4 mm (normal range [mean \u00b1 2SD]: 13.9 \u00b1 4.0 mm []) and an isthmus of 5.2 mm, indicating enlargement. An ultrasound showed no increased blood flow. Radiographs indicated no epiphyseal nucleus of the distal femur, which showed that fetal bone maturation was delayed because of the fetal hypothyroidism.\nThyroid function tests were conducted using the umbilical blood at delivery, and the results were as follows: FT3, 1.7 pg/mL (normal range [mean \u00b1 SD]: 1.70 \u00b1 0.034 pg/ml); FT4, 1.6 ng/dL (normal: 1.17 \u00b1 0.14 ng/dl); and TSH, 25.18 \u03bcIU/mL (normal: 10.27 \u00b1 6.31 \u03bcIU/mL) []. The TRAb level was 17.4 IU/L. No treatment was given until 5 days of age, when thyroid function tests indicated a tendency toward hyperthyroidism, (FT3 = 3.5 pg/mL, FT4 = 2.7 ng/dL, and TSH = 2.56 \u03bcIU/mL). The infant was administered a course of thiamazole (MMI) (0.5 mg/kg/day). No major changes in the size of the infant\u2019s thyroid gland were observed during the hospital stay. Because of neonatal jaundice, the infant was treated with 24-h phototherapy starting at 4 days of age. His progress was stable, and he was discharged at 18 days of age, weighing 3.1 kg. Following discharge, the MMI dose was gradually decreased as TRAb levels dropped, and it was discontinued at 51 days of age. At 10 months of age, the infant\u2019s thyroid function was normal, despite persistent goiter. There was no evidence of any developmental delays. Currently, the infant is under the continuous care of the Department of Pediatrics.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n11.268", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 41-year-old Hispanic male was brought to our hospital ED after having a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure on the street. His past medical history was significant for polysubstance abuse (heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and methadone) and chronic liver disease (hepatitis C). He had history of multiple admissions to our institution for opiates detoxification. On arrival to ED his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 98/63 mmHg, heart rate of 118 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 48 breaths/minute, temperature of 37.5\u00b0C, and an oxygen saturation of 90% while receiving oxygen by a non-rebreather mask. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staffing reported finding a bag of K2 at the scene. Physical examination was remarkable for bilateral rales on lung auscultation. Old needle puncture areas were found over his arms and legs, without erythema. Pupils were equal with positive light reflex. While in ED, he was combative and developed another tonic-clonic seizure episode. Endotracheal intubation was performed and he was placed on mechanical ventilation. Remarkable laboratory findings included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 29.5 K/mm3 (4.8\u201310.8), a bicarbonate level of 15 mmol/L (24\u201331), a lactic acid level of 4.4 mmol/L (0.5\u20132.2), and a urine toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and methadone. Creatine kinase (CK) level was 5,590 U/L (25\u2013215), and troponins were mildly elevated at 1.45 ng/mL (<0.1). Creatinine, coagulation, and liver function profiles were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas (ABG) while on mechanical ventilation and receiving FIO2 of 100% showed a pH of 7.14 (7.35\u20137.45), a pCO2 level of 79 mmHg (34\u201345), and a paO2 level of 77 mmHg (80\u2013100). Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates (). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities ().\nHe was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of acute hypoxemic/hypercapnic respiratory failure presumptively secondary to drug overdose. He required propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam to achieve adequate sedation and ventilatory synchrony. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy consisting of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 grams every 6 hours) was initiated for the possibility of aspiration pneumonitis. While in ICU, CK and troponin levels continued to increase to 18,589 U/L and 8.76 ng/mL, respectively. A new transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed markedly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% (55\u201365), with severe global and segmental hypokinesis and no vegetations or valvular dysfunction. Given the echocardiographic and CXR findings as well as the elevated troponin levels, therapy for acute congestive heart failure probably secondary to a non-ST-segment elevation MI was initiated with low-molecular weight heparin, \u03b2-blockers, aspirin, clopidogrel, diuretics, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Repeated CXR after 24 hours showed near resolution of bilateral infiltrates (). Blood, urine, and respiratory cultures were negative and antimicrobials were discontinued. He was extubated on day 4 of ICU admission but required reintubation because of severe agitation and hypoxemia, which were thought to be a clinical component of a possible withdrawal syndrome. His ICU course was further complicated by fevers, new bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and persistently elevated FIO2 requirements. TTE was repeated, showing a remarkable improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (63%), with a complete resolution of wall motion abnormalities. He was successfully extubated on day 11 of ICU admission, after being treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n3.0", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThis 74-year-old woman was admitted to a community hospital in a rural area of the Mideast USA with the sudden onset of progressive symmetrical weakness of hands and feet, and numbness in a stocking glove distribution. Two weeks prior, she had an episode of abdominal pain and fecal incontinence that resolved. The patient had a 25-year history of hypertension. She also had a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mild depression, urinary tract infections, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, thyroid lobectomy, cosmetic leg vein stripping, and repair of a ventral hernia. She had a remote history of smoking and did not drink alcohol. Her medications included enalapril, furosemide, potassium, montelukast, and amitriptyline plus perphenazine.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head and spine showed no acute processes. CT of the abdomen showed diverticulosis. The patient was started on empiric ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for presumptive urinary tract infection. Four days later, she was transferred to a nursing home for rehabilitation. Two days after that, she was brought back to the community hospital emergency room with profound weakness of her arms and inability to grasp with either hand. She also had increasing paresthesia of her feet. Her serum sodium was 127 mEq/L (reference range [RR]: 135-145 mEq/L). She was admitted with suspected Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. A few days later, she was transferred to a referral hospital for further neurological evaluation.\nOn admission to the referral hospital, the patient was afebrile, with pulse 125/minute, blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, respirations 18/minute and oxygen saturation 97% on supplemental oxygen at 3 L/min. She had distal extremity weakness, worse on the right (0/5) than the left (1-2/5). Sensory examination revealed numbness up to the ankles and wrists. Distal tendon reflexes were absent. Her sodium was 122 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L (RR: 3.6-5 mEq/L), chloride 91 mEq/L (RR: 98-108 mEq/L), bicarbonate 26 mEq/L (RR: 22-26 mEq/L), glucose 98 mg/dL (RR: 65-100 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 8 mg/dL (RR: 7-21 mg/dL), creatinine 0.4 mg/dL (RR: 0.5-1.4), hemoglobin 14.3 g/dL (RR: 12.0-15.2 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume 81.8 fL (RR: 78-101 fL), platelets 243,000/mm3 (RR: 140,000-450,000/mm3), white blood cell (WBC) count 13,500/mm3 (RR: 4,100-10,900/mm3) (83% neutrophils, 12% bands, 2% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 42 mm/hr (RR: <30 mm/hr), rheumatoid factor 226 IU/dL (RR: 40-60 IU/dL), C-reactive protein 16.8 mg/L (\u201chigh risk\u201d >3 mg/L) and anti-nuclear antibody <40 IU/L (RR: <40 IU/L). Lumbar puncture showed cerebrospinal fluid with 1 WBC/mm3 and protein 73 mg/dL (RR: 15-60 mg/dL).\nThe next day, electromyography showed evidence of a severe axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed age-related volume loss with chronic microangiopathic disease. Blood and urine testing for lead and mercury poisoning returned negative. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was started.\nThe next day, the patient was pleasant and conversant despite persistent sodium levels between 120 and 129 mEq/L. Her upper and lower extremities showed 2+ edema. CT showed marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, a small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was negative. Serology for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Lyme disease IgM returned negative. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone was suspected and fluid restriction commenced.\nThe next day, a rheumatologist elicited a history of 2 episodes in the past 9 months of frontal headache, dry mouth, anorexia and early satiety; also, the patient had been told by an optometrist that she had dry eyes, but this was asymptomatic. The patient had remained afebrile in the hospital, with blood pressure 117-142 / 50-70 mm Hg. On examination by the rheumatologist, the patient had a non-blanching erythematous skin rash over her feet, palpable purpura over her left breast, loss of sensation from her feet up to her knees and from her fingertips to her elbows, inability to move her legs and right arm, areflexia, and glossitis, but no salivary or parotid gland enlargement. The WBC count was 13,700/mm3, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, BUN 8 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.3 mg/dL. The rheumatologist suspected vasculitis and prednisone (50 mg daily) was started. C3 complement was later reported 110 mg/dL (RR: 79-152 mg/dL), C4 complement <10 mg/dL (RR: 13-75 mg/dL), and serum protein electrophoresis and cryoglobulin test negative. Over the next few days, there was no neurological improvement, but the patient's serum sodium rose to 132 mEq/L.\nThe next day, the patient reported feeling much better, but that night began having episodes of confusion and delirium. Immunoglobulin therapy was discontinued and trazodone was started. The following day, she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her oxygen saturation was 98-100%. She appeared comfortable. Her lungs were clear. Her neurological status remained unchanged. The next day, serology for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB was negative. The following day, open biopsies of the peroneus brevis muscle and peroneal and sural nerves were performed, which revealed necrotizing vasculitis of vessels in muscle and sural nerve, active and chronic neurogenic muscular changes, epineural fibrosis and chronic axonal loss.\nThe next day, the patient developed a large hematoma of unclear etiology in her upper right arm. Her platelet count dropped from 230,000/mm3 to 136,000/mm3. Chest radiograph showed unchanged left basilar atelectasis. The patient was receiving stress-ulcer prophylaxis as well as deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Bilateral venous duplex examination of her upper extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Immunofluorescence for anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies was reported negative at a dilution of 1:20 (normal <1:40).\nThe following day, the patient exhibited acute mental status changes. Her hemoglobin dropped from 11.7 g/dL to 9.2 g/dL over 12 hours. CT showed a large left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema; this compressed the posterior aspect of the left lateral ventricle and induced a small amount of midline shift. A decompressive craniotomy was performed. Follow-up CT showed a decrease in compression of the left ventricle and decreased midline shift. Electroencephalogram showed severely abnormal diffuse slowing, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, bi-hemispheric epileptiform discharges, and an electrographic seizure. Intravenous phenytoin (100 mg) was given.\nThe patient\u2019s family was informed that she was not likely to make a meaningful recovery. A decision was reached with the family to provide comfort measures only and the patient died several days later.\nPostmortem examination revealed necrotizing vasculitis in skeletal muscle, ( and ), peripheral nerves, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, liver, adrenals, kidneys, lungs and pericardium, involving predominantly medium-sized arteries, but also some large parenchymal arteries in the liver, associated with multifocal thromboses in liver (up to 2 cm), myocardium, thoracic lymph nodes and left adrenal gland, and hemorrhages in left parietal-occipital cerebrum (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm), upper right arm (29 \u00d7 18 cm), stomach, intestines, bladder, pericardium, trachea, mesentery, omentum, right ovary and right breast. In addition to and , a virtual (digital) slide of skeletal muscle is available for viewing at the Larry Nichols collection. It is case 003.\nAutopsy also revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving arterioles, capillaries and venules in the skin ().\nAutopsy also revealed a small, 0.6 cm, moderately differentiated, invasive adenocarcinoma in the cecum. The cerebral blood vessels had severe hypertensive vasculopathy and moderate atherosclerosis in those of the circle of Willis, but no vasculitis. There was severe acute transmural ischemic colitis of the rectum, a microscopic acute infarct of the left adrenal, and moderate coronary atherosclerosis, with up to 60% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The myocardium had a microscopic area of necrosis adjacent to a thrombosed arteriole. The aorta had moderate atherosclerosis and mild cystic medial degeneration, but no aortitis. The pulmonary arteries contained a branched, recently formed (4 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.3 cm) thrombus in the left lower lobe, a branched, recently formed (6 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.5 cm) thrombus in the right middle lobe, microscopic non-occlusive thrombi, and multifocal fibrous intimal thickening suggestive of previous organized thromboemboli, but no vasculitis. The skin had petechiae and ecchymoses on the trunk and limbs.

At admission, her body temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, pulse rate 78 beats/minute, respiratory rate 20/minute, and blood pressure 136/98 mmHg. Her family and environmental history were unremarkable. She did not receive surgery before nor take any medication for systemic disease, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. She was a housekeeper. She did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol. On physical examination, she had normal breathing sound, without wheezing or crackle, and a regular heartbeat without murmur. Her abdomen was soft with normoactive bowel sound on auscultation. Her extremities were freely moveable without edema. She exhibited severe morbid obesity (body weight, 128.4 kg; height, 155.7 cm; BMI, 52.9 kg/m2). Her daily activities were independent most of the time, except for some episodes of exertional dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a ventral hernia with a large fascial defect (Fig. ). There were no clinical symptoms, such as abdominal pain or tenderness. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and ventral herniorrhaphy with Goretex mesh (GORE DUALMESH\u00ae).\nHer early postoperative course was smooth. She consumed water on postoperative day (POD) 3, a clear-liquid diet on POD5, and a semi-liquid diet on POD7. She began bedside ambulation, and half of her stitches were removed on POD10. However, progressive dyspnea was noted after bedside ambulation. Intra-abdominal free air with elevation of right-side hemidiaphragm was noted by chest X-ray (Fig. ) on POD14. There was no abdominal tenderness or rebounding pain, but there was moderate abdominal distension. She was kept under close observation and began nil by mouth (NPO) for possible visceral perforation.\nTwo days later (POD16), severe dyspnea and extensive abdominal distention were noted. Her respiratory rate was elevated to 26/minute with accessory muscle use. Arterial blood gas analysis (under simple O2 mask, 10 L/minute) showed: pH, 7.42; partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2), 44.8 (mmHg); partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), 86.2 (mmHg); bicarbonate (HCO3-), 28.5 (mmol/L); blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), 96.7%; and blood pressure, 102/75 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,900/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dL, and platelet count 310,000/uL. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 165.7 mg/dL. Serum creatinine was 0.99 mg/dL, while serum sodium was 131 mmol/L, and potassium was 3.9 mmol/l. A physical examination showed severe abdominal distension without rebound pain. A pelvic examination demonstrated good healing of the vaginal cuff without leakage. CT showed a large amount of intra-peritoneal free air with little ascites (Fig. ). Because clinical visceral perforation was less likely, under the impression of pneumoperitoneum, in this emergent situation, an 8-Fr. pigtail catheter was inserted under CT guidance for decompression. A massive amount of gas was drained. Subsequently, her dyspnea and abdominal distention dramatically subsided. She re-started oral intake on POD20, and the abdominal pigtail catheter was removed on POD24 after no more free air was revealed by chest X-ray. No further abdominal distention was noted, and she was discharged on POD28.

She underwent chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed for 10 courses. As disease progression was observed during chemotherapy, nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) was initiated in October 2018. In January 2019, after the eighth course of nivolumab treatment, the patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. During the perioperative period, nivolumab administration was continued. Just after the surgery, she noted mild intermittent abdominal pain, which continued for 2 months. An abdominal CT scan was performed but showed no causative abnormalities, even at the surgical sites. Two weeks later, just after the 12th course of nivolumab, the patient visited an emergency department and complained of worse abdominal pain and general fatigue.\nOn physical examination, her level of consciousness was normal, and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 88/77 mm Hg, pulse rate 115 beats per minute, SpO2 95% on ambient air, respiratory rate 16 per minute, and body temperature 37.2\u00b0C.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 17-year-old woman with primary amenorrhea was sent to us with a diagnosis of Rokitansky syndrome. The patient was born via normal delivery at a weight of 2400 g when her mother was 17. She was admitted to the hospital at an age of 8 days due to vomiting and moderate dystrophy; she was then diagnosed with primary right PH. She was later readmitted several times for pulmonary insufficiency. Two months later, a diagnosis of congenital right pulmonary hypoplasia with hypoplasia of the right lung artery was confirmed. In an ultrasound examination performed 7 months later, the right kidney was not observed. From more recent (at an age of 15 years) X-ray images taken of the pelvis in the Emergency Unit, the patient was also diagnosed with right hip dysplasia; this condition was initially defined as old secondary osteonecrosis of the right femoral head.\nThe patient reported three years of genital and mammary development as well as cyclic pelvic pain for 4-5 days every month despite the primary amenorrhea. She weighed 42 kg and was 153 cm tall. The physical examination revealed normal external genital development and normal breasts. There was complete vaginal atresia. In the combined rectal examination, the pelvis was noted to be free. A transrectal ultrasound did not confirm the presence of a uterus. In this ultrasound examination, there was difficulty visualizing the ovaries; on the right side, however, vascular dilatations or multicystic embryonary remnants could be observed. The abdominal ultrasound did not show the presence of a right kidney. General and hormonal analyses were normal (FSH 3.9 mUI/mL, LH 6.2 mUI/mL, PRL 7.9 ng/mL, E2 35 pg/mL, P 0.3 ng/mL), and chest X-rays and i.v. pyelography showed right pulmonary hypoplasia, dysplasia of the right hip, and right renal agenesis with a normal left kidney and ureter (see Figure ). Later, a conventional cytogenetic study revealed a normal female karyotype 46, XX at a level of 550 GTG bands. A CGH analysis was performed using a 244K oligoarray CGH (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), detecting 11 copy number variants (CNV) described as normal variants in the databases. Some CNVs (17q12 and 22q11.21 microdeletions) described in other MRKH patients were not present in this case. The geneticists have been studying her family history and Figure shows the pedigree of the family, compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\nEight months later, a new transrectal ultrasound was performed. Again, there was no evidence to suggest any functioning rudimentary uterine horn. The right ovary appeared to be normal, and there were the same vascular dilatations or multicystic remnants previously seen on the right side. The left ovary was also difficult to identify properly. The patient, who visited the clinic with her parents, wished operation and to have a neovagina created. She was therefore scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy and creation of a neovagina according to the McIndoe technique with a prosthesis and skin graft.\nLaparoscopy confirmed the absence of uterus. There was a varicocele and/or retroperitoneal multicystic formations on the right side of the small pelvis. On both sides, an elongated, solid, rudimentary uterine horn could be observed. At its superior end, there were ovaries that were elongated, somewhat dysgenetic (more on the right side), and located very high in both abdominal flanks (Figure ). Rudimentary tubes could also be observed. Although the uterine rudimentary tract was slightly thicker on the left side, there did not appear to be even minimal endometrial cavitation of the solid uterine rudimentary horn. Sectioning and dissection from the introitum to the inside below the urethra was performed via a transperineal procedure, thus forming a wide vaginal neocavity reaching the Douglas pouch. Interestingly, the dissection of the neovaginal cavity tended more toward the left fundus than the right, as if there were more atresia on the right side of the supposed location of the vagina. A prosthesis with a skin graft taken from the right buttock was applied, with Interceed\u00ae placed between the skin and the prosthesis (Figure ). The drawing of the genital tract of the patient generated in the surgery theater is shown in Figure . After 10 days, the prosthesis was removed and the state of the neovagina was assessed. After replacement of the prosthesis, the patient was discharged. The patient returned for a follow-up visit 6 months after the operation, and her evolution was normal. She then underwent transvaginal ultrasound that did not show the ovaries properly but showed the multicystic embryonary remnants in the right hemipelvis. An uretrocystoscopy showed absence of ectopic ureter and of the right hemitrigone. Likewise, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) showed right renal agenesis with probable embryonary remnants of a disgenetic kidney in the right hemipelvis with a multicystic morphology (see Figure ). Those cysts seem to have slightly increased in the transvaginal ultrasound, but four years after operation her evolution is normal, without symptoms and the neovagina is adequately functional.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n44.426", "task": "calc"}

This occurred on a background of more long-standing non-specific lethargy. There was a history of a recent long-haul flight from Nigeria to Ireland one week previously. At presentation, he exhibited a tachycardia of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/94 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.\nAn electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with symmetrical T wave inversion in praecordial lead V3. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a PaO2 of 7.5 kPa, PaCO2 of 3.8 kPa, pH 7.47, and an oxygen saturation of 89%. A D-dimer assay performed at triage was significantly elevated at 10.5 mg/L. Given the working diagnosis of probable pulmonary embolus (high-risk pretest probability), therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin 120 mg subcutaneously) was administered prior to emergent Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA).\nTwo hours later, while awaiting emergent CTPA, the patient collapsed and was found to be in cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was promptly initiated for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Intubation with a cuffed oroendotracheal tube (COETT) was achieved without interruption of chest compressions. Despite primary confirmation of COETT placement, end-tidal CO2 was not detected initially. Subxiphoid ultrasound\u2014performed during brief interruption of chest compressions\u2014did not reveal a dilated right side of heart. Despite this, given the overall clinical picture at this juncture, a presumptive diagnosis of massive or saddle pulmonary embolus was made.\nAlong with conventional ACLS adrenaline therapy, rtPA (alteplase) 50 mg was promptly administered. Despite continuing high quality chest compressions and a gradual rise in quantitative end-tidal CO2, no cardiac output was detected after twenty minutes. A decision was taken to administer a second bolus of rtPA (alteplase) 50 mg. Ten minutes subsequent to this and following on-going advanced life support, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved with an initial non-invasive blood pressure of 144/50 mmHg.\nStandard post-ROSC resuscitation care was instituted and this gentleman was admitted to the intensive care unit. A CTPA demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was continued on Enoxaparin and bridged to Warfarin once critical care stability was achieved. No major (or minor) bleeding was observed during this gentleman's hospital stay.

At the time of presentation, she had intermittent (angina) chest pain, pedal oedema, and dyspnoea at minimal exertion. For the last 2 months, she had anorexia and weight loss (4 kg in 1 month). There were no documented episodes of fever. Her past medical history was significant for hypothyroidism, well-controlled on levothyroxine supplementation.\nOn evaluation, the patient was normotensive, pulse regular, and afebrile. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for mild bilateral pedal oedema. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and was otherwise unremarkable. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 56 and C-reactive protein (CRP) 22.4 mg/L; normal <7.5 mg/L. Her N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide level was 74.6 pg/mL. HIV antibodies were negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two-dimensional echocardiography (Figure ) revealed mild pericardial effusion with pericardial thickness of 0.58 cm. Inferior vena cava was dilated (2.12 cm with no respiratory variation) and significant trans-mitral and trans tricuspid respiratory flow variation suggestive of effusive constrictive pericarditis. Though annulus reversus could not be documented (e\u2019l = 8.70 cm/s and e\u2019s = 7.72 cm/s), e\u2019l and e\u2019s were almost equal and e\u2019l was reduced. E/e\u2019 were 8.48 for septal and 7.53 for lateral annulus. Contrast-enhanced tomography of thorax (Figure ) revealed mild pericardial effusion with thickened pericardium [along right ventricular (RV) free wall 6.9 mm and along left ventricular (LV) free wall 7.5 mm] with biatrial enlargement; it also revealed few homogenous subcentimetric prevascular, pre-, and para- tracheal lymph nodes without any necrosis. There was left-sided pleural effusion along with atelectatic bands in bilateral lung bases, left lingula, and bilateral upper lobes and traction bronchiectasis along medial segment of right middle lobe. Overall the computed tomography (CT) images were suggestive of chronic infective aetiology.\nCardiac catheterization revealed equalization of diastolic pressures with significant respiratory variation in LV and RV pressures. Coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial coronaries. These findings strongly suggested a constrictive physiology.\nAs tuberculosis is the commonest aetiology of constrictive pericarditis in the Indian subcontinent, and as there was evidence of lung involvement, the patient was started on ATT (isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol for 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months). The patient improved over the next 4 months, there was return of appetite with weight gain; and the repeat echocardiography (Figure ) was normal with no features of either constriction or effusion. Repeat ESR was 31 and CRP came down to 8 mg/L. Repeat CT also revealed normalization of pericardial thickening and enhancement when compared with the earlier. It also revealed clearance of pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and lung findings when compared with the earlier CT. To evaluate the symptoms and to document the functional capacity of the patient, treadmill test was done which was normal with good functional capacity.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?", "output": "### Response:\n2", "task": "calc"}

The patient reported a headache that was diffuse, severe in intensity, throbbing in nature, and gradual in onset. The headache started when he lay down to sleep that evening. It was associated with nausea and numbness and tingling in his bilateral hands and feet. The headache was preceded by several hours of fatigue and generalized weakness. The patient drank six 12-ounce beers before going to bed. The friend at the bedside explained that he typically drank that amount, and expressed concern because the patient seemed much more intoxicated than he typically would be after drinking that amount.\nThe patient had a past medical history of depression and anxiety. He had a surgical history of an open reduction and internal fixation of a right calcaneal fracture 10 years prior. He took sertraline 100 milligrams (mg) daily, and had no drug allergies. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day and was a daily drinker, but had not experienced alcohol withdrawal. He denied use of illicit drugs. Family history was notable for a cerebrovascular accident and myocardial infarction in his parents, and vertigo in a sibling. He worked as a contractor for a gas and electric company, and spent most of his day outside. He had no recent travel history. A review of systems revealed a one-week history of right ankle pain, swelling, and redness that the patient attributed to a \u201cspider bite.\u201d\nThe patient was alert, oriented, and uncomfortable but non-toxic appearing on the initial exam. His temperature was 36.8\u00b0 Celsius (C), with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 139/83 millimeters (mm) of mercury, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. He weighed 82.6 kilograms (kg), was 1.96 meters tall with a body mass index of 22.5 kg/m2. He appeared well developed and well nourished. His head was normocephalic and atraumatic. He had moist mucous membranes, without oral lesions, and with a normal oropharynx. Pupils were 2 mm, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light. His extraocular movements were normal. There was no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. Visual acuity was grossly normal. The neck was supple without cervical lymphadenopathy, meningismus, or midline or paraspinal cervical spine tenderness. Heart was regular rate and rhythm, without murmur, rubs, or gallops. Breath sounds were clear bilaterally without wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdomen was soft and nontender, without rebound, guarding, or rigidity, and with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good distal pulses.\nThere was a small area of blanching erythema and ecchymosis in the right lateral malleolar region. There was no increased warmth, edema, other evidence of trauma, or painful or limited range of motion of the ankle. Neurologic exam showed cranial nerves II\u2013XII intact, 4/5 strength throughout the bilateral upper extremities, 5/5 strength throughout the bilateral lower extremities, with normal tone, and normal sensation throughout. Speech was clear and fluent, and mood and affect were appropriate. Skin was warm and dry. A papular rash was noted on his lower extremities (). It did not involve the palms or soles.\nThe patient\u2019s initial laboratory testing results are shown in . His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with normal axis, normal intervals, and no ST-segment elevation, depression, or T-wave inversions. Two hours after his initial evaluation, he began vomiting and complained of dysarthria, dysphagia, and vertigo. Tongue fasciculations were present. He received a dose of metoclopramide. Due to concern for an acute cerebral vascular accident, a computed tomography (CT) of the head, and a CT angiography of the head and neck were subsequently performed and showed no acute abnormality. Neurology was consulted, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain without contrast was obtained per their recommendation. The MRI was markedly limited by motion artifact and was of poor diagnostic quality. As described by radiology, the image showed foci of increased fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal involving portions of the cortex of the frontal lobes bilaterally, deep periventricular white matter, left side of midbrain, throughout the pons, and in the deep left cerebellar hemisphere.\nThe patient was reassessed when he returned from MRI. His BP and heart rate were relatively unchanged, but he was febrile (38.4\u00b0C). The patient had become somnolent and he was no longer managing his oral secretions. It was determined that he was no longer adequately protecting his airway. He was intubated without complication, blood cultures were drawn, and he was started on empiric broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

His medical history revealed a ten-year history of diabetes mellitus (DM), uncertain hypertension history, and previous knee surgery. The patient suffered from occasional dyspnea and chest discomfort. An ECG showed a sinus bradycardia of 57 bpm and a 99-m Tc-MIBI scan was normal. Laboratory tests showed glucose 4+ on urinalysis, HbA1c 10.0%, and serum glucose around 200-300 mg/dL.\nAt the pre-anesthesia preparation room, ECG and pulse oximetry were applied and blood pressure (BP) was measured non-invasively at 5-min intervals. The initial BP was 104/56 mmHg with a heart rate (HR) of 57 bpm. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was administered using a 17-gauge Tuohy needle and 27-gauge Whitacre spinal needle at the level of the L3-4 interspace under standard aseptic conditions. Upon the first attempt, the epidural space was found using a loss of resistance technique, and clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained after spinal needle insertion. There were no paresthesias. A total of 2.0 mL of 0.5% tetracaine, mixed with saline, the patient's CSF, and epinephrine 1 : 200,000, was administered slowly to the patient. An epidural catheter was inserted without resistance and advanced 5 cm upward (by having the bevel of the needle pointed cephalad) and a sensory block to T12 was achieved by a pin-prick test. Then, BP dropped to 87/46 mmHg, and the sensory block was checked at T6. Ephedrine hydrochloride 12 mg and 20 mg was administered intravenously and intramuscularly, respectively. BP raised to 120/65 mmHg, and the patient was transferred to the operating room. In the operating room, BP was 147/69 mmHg and rose to 153/79 mmHg after turning a tourniquet on. Then, the patient complained of a sudden onset of a severe headache and became restless. The BP recorded at the onset of the headache was 190/123 mmHg, and HR was 75 bpm. No ECG changes were noted. Labetalol hydrochloride (10 mg) was injected, and, to sedate the patient, midazolam (2 mg) was injected, but the patient was still irritable. Then, thiopental sodium (100 mg) was injected via IV. BP was maintained around 160/65 mmHg for an hour before a sudden tachycardia of 140 bpm and BP of 200/97 mmHg was observed. Lidocaine (80 mg) was injected and isosorbide dinitrate infusion began due to ST depression. The patient was semi-comatose with asymmetric pupils. BP gradually decreased and was maintained around 105/60 mmHg. After taking a brain CT scan, the patient was transferred to the ICU.\nThe brain CT showed a large amount of SAH and an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (), and a CT brain angiogram showed a 6-mm ruptured intracranial aneurysm at the anterior communicating cerebral artery (ACOM) and a 4-mm unruptured cerebral aneurysm at the left middle cerebral artery bifurcation ( and ). GDC coil embolization at the ACOM was performed, and external ventricular drainage was carried out.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 26-year-old Chinese female patient was referred to our hospital for recurrent spontaneous hypoglycemia on January 14, 2016. Complaining of palpitations, sweating, tremors, and anxiety, she was diagnosed with Graves disease at the local hospital on August 24, 2015, and prescribed methimazole 10 mg 3 times daily. She became pregnant on October 31, 2015. On November 31, 2015, she frequently developed episodes of dizziness, fatigue, cold sweat, palpitations, tremor, and symptoms of drowsiness during the night and morning. In the evening of January 14, 2016, she suddenly lost consciousness and was immediately sent to a local hospital and diagnosed with hypoglycemia based on a plasma glucose concentration of 1.9 mmol/L (normal range, 3.90\u20136.10 mmol/L). Her symptoms were relieved following intravenous glucose infusion. Later, she repeatedly experienced hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.1\u20132.8 mmol/L) at night and early morning. Laboratory measurements were fasting C-peptide 10.56 ng/mL, 2-h postprandial C peptide 12 ng/mL, and 2-h postprandial insulin 276.53 ng/L.\nTo identify the reasons for hypoglycemia and to exclude islet beta cell tumor disease, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. She had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or previous exposure to insulin or oral antidiabetic agents. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus. She had a 6-month history of Graves disease and pregnancy for 10 weeks.\nOn physical examination at admission, her weight was 52 kg, height 1.55 m, body mass index (BMI) 21.64 kg/m2, blood pressure 104/76 mm Hg, and pulse rate 106 beats per min. The swollen thyroid was II degrees and bump texture soft, no obvious palpable nodules or tenderness, and no extra vascular murmur.\nRoutine laboratory blood tests of hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal function, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), liver function, and adrenal function were found to be normal (Table ). C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and anti-dsDNA antibodies were negative. Human chorionic gonadotropin level was positive for pregnancy. The thyroid function test indicated hyperthyroidism (Table ).\nAt 03:00 h on January 17, 2016, blood glucose was 2.26 mmol/L and glycosylated hemoglobin was 5.4% (normal range 4.5\u223c6.3%). She had no history of prolonged fasting. Spontaneous symptomatic hypoglycemic occurred again soon after admission and serum insulin, blood glucose, and serum C-peptide release were measured (Fig. ). The serum levels of insulin and C-peptide were both inappropriately elevated in the presence of hypoglycemia, confirming the diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Blood glucose monitor using the Dextrostix/Eyetone system (LifeScan Company, Johnson & Johnson, New Jersey, New Brunswick) results indicated hypoglycemia at 02:00 to 04:00 h, the lowest result was 1.65 mmol/L, but during the day glucose results were generally normal. In addition, unusually high levels of insulin autoantibodies (up to 33.69%; normal < 5%) were measured in the serum, and we assumed that these insulin-binding autoantibodies belonged to the IgG class. Anti-islet \u03b2-cell autoantibodies tests indicated that ICA, tyrosine phosphatase antibody (IAA-2), and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA-65) were negative, but the insulin autoantibody (insulin resistance IgG antibody) level was positive (Table ).\nTo further identity the relationship between the serum concentrations of insulin, glucose, and C-peptide, the patient had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin release test, and C-peptide release test (Table ). The levels of insulin and C-peptide were markedly increased, and there was no history of exogenous insulin administration as the cause of hypoglycemia. Magnetic resonance of the abdomen and ultrasound results showed no space-occupying lesions in the pancreas. The outcomes indicated that IAS might have induced the hypoglycemia.\nAfter inspection of the symptoms and laboratory, endocrinological, and imaging results together with no history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and no previous exposure to insulin or oral antidiabetic agents, we excluded insulinoma and adrenal hypofunction. Consequently, we made a diagnosis of IAS with possible methimazole association. However, pregnancy is another factor that can induce IAS.\nThe patient had an abortion, discontinued methimazole and switched to oral prednisone (30 mg once daily) and propylthiouracil (100 mg 3 times daily) for 3 months. During the follow-up visit after 3 months, the patient had not experienced any further hypoglycemic episodes, and prednisone was maintained at 5 mg once daily. The insulin and C-peptide levels had decreased to normal levels, and insulin autoantibodies levels were negative. The symptoms caused by Graves disease had also improved with drug treatment. The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (sTSH) level was <0.005 mU/L, free triiodothyronine (FT3) level was 16.10 pg/mL, and free (unbound) thyroxine (FT4) was 5.58 ng/dL.\nEthical approval was not necessary because our study is a case report.\nThis patient signed an informed consent before publication.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n85.333", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nIn the past year, a 57-year-old Caucasian female (61 kg, 166 cm) felt gradually empty, exhausted, tired, and lethargic. In addition, she perceived constipation and cold intolerance, which was accompanied by a decline of appetite, concentration, and productivity. She attributed her complaints to the growing level of distress at her work as a teacher and preferred to watch and wait without consulting a physician. Apart from that, her medical, addiction, and familial history were unremarkable. In the last four weeks, she developed a state of apathy and mutism combined with fluctuating confusion, amnesia, disorganization, and incontinence, which led to hospital treatment that was initiated by her husband. Upon emergency admission, a hypoactive delirium and severe hypothyroidism were diagnosed (). Physical and neurologic examination showed signs of hypothyroidism (shortness of breath, bradycardia, hypothermia, swollen limbs, dry skin, delayed relaxation of tendon reflexes, and myalgia) []. Transabdominal echocardiography found pericardial effusion []. Routine lab checks revealed further signs of hypothyroidism, such AST- and CK-elevations and hypercholesterinemia () []. Alcohol intoxication and hyperammonemia were excluded. Moreover, macrocytic anemia was found together with slight hyperhomocysteinemia (12.4 \u03bcmol/L, reference level <9 \u03bcmol/L), but without laboratory vitamin B deficiency (normal serum levels of vitamins B1, B6, B9, and B12, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin). Vitamin D was found to be slightly reduced and substituted then. The EEG was slightly slowed (). The brain MR imaging showed a few unspecific T2-hyperintense areas in the white matter (WMH) of both temporal lobes, which could be compatible with severe hypothyroidism, vasculitis, or autoimmune encephalopathy. In the serum, elevated TPO-Abs () were found which pointed to Hashimoto thyroiditis [, , ] being responsible for the hypothyroidism. This was underlined by an atrophic thyroid gland in ultrasound. Regarding the remaining serum antithyroid autoantibodies, TSH-receptor autoantibodies (TR-Abs, ) were also elevated and thyroglobulin autoantibodies were normal. Later on, elevated autoantibodies against parietal cells (PC-Abs, ) and intrinsic factor (11.43 U/mL, normal <1.5 U/mL) were found, which most likely corresponded to a helicobacter pylorus-negative lymphocytic gastroduodenitis in histopathology (up to 80 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial nuclei, T-lymphocytes) and macrocytic anemia. The lymphocyte typing of the blood found increased T-helper-lymphocytes (1350/\u03bcL, normal 645\u20131289/\u03bcL), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within its normal range, and no evidence of a cellular immune deficiency as being measured in the last asymptomatic month (). Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative. There were no clinical or immunologic signs of Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, alopecia, or celiac disease. Thus, outside the CNS, the autoimmune disease appeared to be limited to a gastroduodenal-thyroidal syndrome, classified as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 3B []. Other forms of limbic encephalopathies that could have been associated with antibodies against intracellular, synaptic, or other cell surface antigenic targets [], neoplasm, connective tissue, or vasculitis diseases [, ] were excluded.\nIn the CSF, TPO-Abs (33.8 IU/mL, normal: 0\u20138 IU/mL) [] were detected, while TR-Abs and thyroglobulin antibodies were not investigated. Moreover, CSF protein (43.7 mg/dL, normal 15\u201335 mg/dL), S-100 protein (3200 pg/mL, normal <2700 pg/mL), and neuronal specific \u03b1-enolase (NSE, 16.9 \u03bcg/L, normal <13 \u03bcg/L) were elevated. Pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands were missing. Also, neurodegeneration markers (beta-amyloid, tau-, and phospho-tau protein), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, titers of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA, and IgG), IgM-, IgA-, and IgG-indices, antibody index for either herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, measles virus, rubella virus, or Borrelia burgdorferi, and 14-3-3 protein were unremarkable in the CSF.\nOphthalmological, angiological, and nephrological examinations were unremarkable, too. Subsequent electrocardiograms, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, and the remaining serum routine lab including ferritin and transferrin were normal as well as immunoglobulins including subclasses, carbohydrate deficient transferrin, parathyroid hormone, lysozyme, ACE, carbohydrate deficient transferrin, gastrin, and serum autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and the amino terminal of \u03b1-enolase (NAE). Virus hepatitis, HIV, herpes, syphilis, Lyme disease, and M. Whipple were excluded. Drug urine screen was negative.\nRegarding the increasing somnolence and falling heart rate (down to 40 bpm) and body temperature (down to 33.8\u00b0C) the critical care management included an accelerated thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT) with L-thyroxine (IV, 250 \u03bcg/day in the first 5 days) and IV glucocorticoids (125 mg/day IV methylprednisolone) to prevent the progression of the hypoactive delirium to myxedema coma []. In the next few days, the critical condition improved. Hypothermia and bradycardia resolved within 36 hours and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) started to fall. Simultaneously, the delirium turned into a mixed state (), requiring low doses of haloperidol (up to 10 mg/day) and clonazepam (up to 1 mg/day) to cope with arising visual or auditory hallucinations and agitation.\nWhen the results of elevated serum TPO-Abs came in, the IV glucocorticoid treatment was enhanced to 250 mg/day IV methylprednisolone assuming that the delirium was based on HE [, ]. Thereafter, the mixed delirium (fluctuating vigilance, disorientation, disorganization, starring, memory impairment, irritability, hallucinations, and delusion of reference) turned to a hyperactive state with striking manic features (euphoria, grandiosity, racing thoughts, sleeplessness, and risky and reckless behavior). Meanwhile, the patient's physical condition had been stabilized and she was voluntarily transferred from the critical care unit to the psychiatric ward. Assuming that the glucocorticoids had evoked the mania, the prednisolone dose was reduced to 25 mg/day which was followed by a worsening of both delirium and mania (). A subsequent pulse therapy of 1000 mg/day IV methylprednisolone over 3 days was associated with a prompt resolution of the delirium and improvement of the mania (). As the mania did not completely resolve along with oral prednisolone (100 mg/day), the treatment was augmented with quetiapine (up to 300 mg/day). The patient became euthymic within the next 3 weeks and could be transferred to an outpatient treatment (). Quetiapine and prednisolone were tapered within the subsequent 4 and 24 weeks, respectively, without changing the normal mental and physical health condition under THRT alone, which is still continuing up until now, 3 years later (). No further medications were required. Vitamin D supplementation was stopped after 6 months and the 25-OH-vitamin D-levels were normal in the controls carried out every six months.\nSerum antithyroid autoantibody titers respond to the glucocorticoid treatment without a timely correlation with the patient's mental status (). TR-Abs sustainably normalized while TPO-Abs gradually increased after glucocorticoid taper, however, without a worsening of her normal mental status (). Simultaneously, the THRT could be reduced (). Macrocytic anemia resolved although the PC-Ab titers increased progressively () and antibodies against the intrinsic factor were found. Vitamin B levels, holotranscobalamin, and homocysteine were controlled every six months and remained normal. Brain MR imaging and EEG normalized under the combined glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone treatment, which corresponded to the resolution of delirious mania (). Furthermore, brain MR imaging and EEG were normal in the controls carried out 12 and 30 months after termination of the glucocorticoid treatment.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n57.814", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 22-year-old South Indian man with a previous history of Fontan surgery at the age of 13 for double outlet right ventricle with severe pulmonary stenosis and straddling tricuspid valve presented with a spiking high-grade fever of 25-day duration. He had no history of cough, ear discharge, respiratory infection, dysuria, diarrhea, gastrointestinal distress or vomiting.\nHis past history included surgery for a brain abscess at the age of 13, Fontan surgery at the age of 13, ocular surgery for retinal detachment at the age of 16, and multiple small skin abscesses chiefly on his left foot, which recurred after treatment and led to an excision of an abscess on his foot. At the age of 20, he was diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy.\nThe last echocardiography performed before his hospitalization showed a right to left flow in the Fontan circuit, signifying a flow of de-oxygenated blood from the intended pulmonic to the systemic circulation.\nOn physical examination, he was found to be febrile with a temperature of 39\u00b0C on admission, a pulse rate of 88 per minute, a respiratory rate of 26 per minute, blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 89 percent in room air. A head to toe examination identified clubbing of his nails, a median sternotomy scar, mild abdominal distension and pedal edema. His teeth and oral cavity were found to be normal. He was 174 cm tall and weighed 51 kg.\nHis laboratory data on admission showed the following: white blood cells (WBCs) 14,000/mm3, neutrophils 84.5 percent, lymphocytes 8.3 percent, eosinophils 0.2 percent, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 45 mm/hour, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, urea 19 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, sodium 122 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, total protein 3.7 g/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL and serum globulin 2.4 g/dL. He tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. A further work-up for immune deficiency could not be performed for logistical reasons. A urine analysis showed 20-25 red blood cells and 10-12 WBCs per high-power field.\nA 2 D echocardiography revealed no vegetations. An ultrasound scan revealed a mass in his left kidney measuring 7.2 \u00d7 4 cm. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a hypodense area in the lower pole of his left kidney measuring 5.28 \u00d7 6.22 cm, consistent with a renal abscess, which was percutaneously aspirated and grew highly sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Special staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Figure shows the CT images. His blood cultures were repeatedly negative. One of the urine cultures grew Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. The E. coli was sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone and/or sulbactam, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, natamycin, nitrofurantoin, and piperacillin and/or tazobactam. The Enterococcus species was sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, gentamicin, imipenem, linezolid, meropenem and nitrofurantoin.\nOn the basis of the sensitivity of the S. aureus isolated from the abscess, he was treated with intravenous gentamicin, 80 mg at eight-hourly intervals, and with intravenous teicoplanin, 400 mg once per day.\nHe continued experiencing spikes of high-grade fever, and a repeat ultrasound after 12 days of appropriate therapy showed only minimal resolution of the lesion. Surgery was anticipated. A technetium-99 m renogram was performed to see the split function of the kidney with the abscess and to determine whether or not a partial nephrectomy could be performed. The renogram revealed a total glomerular filtration rate of 94 mL/min, with the left kidney contributing 36 mL/min and the right kidney 58 mL/min, and no evidence of obstruction. Figure shows the results of the technetium-99 m renogram.\nIn view of the persistence of the abscess, he underwent a surgical exploration of the renal bed. An attempt was made to carry out a partial nephrectomy of the affected region. However, this failed and so a left nephrectomy was performed. Figure shows the nephrectomy specimen. Figures and show the histopathological picture.\nPost-operatively, his fever subsided and the antibiotic coverage was continued for one week with teicoplanin and gentamicin. At the time of his discharge, his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL.\nA histopathological examination of the diseased kidney revealed infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes. The replacement of renal parenchymal tissue by sheets of foamy histiocytes admixed with neutrophils was observed and this was consistent with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. A special stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Clinical, radiological and histopathological examinations failed to provide any evidence of an obstructive lesion in his urinary tract or of renal calculi.\nTwo weeks after his discharge from hospital, he complained of fever. A CT scan of his abdomen was performed and a residual renal bed abscess was found. A pigtail catheter was inserted and daily aspiration and antibiotic instillation were performed. A week later he was discharged again, with oral antibiotics.\nAbout seven months after the surgery, he remained in a perfect state of health without reports of further infection. This also signified the absence of inherent immune deficiency.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Abdominal examination revealed that the abdominal region was leveled and soft without any pressure or pain, and no palpable masses or superficial lymph nodes were observed. Hematological tests showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.8 g/dL, indicating anemia, and no abnormalities were indicated by CEA, CA19-9, and AFP tumor markers were observed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like mass with delle and bridging fold in the greater curvature of the lower stomach, and the tumor was suspected as the cause of anemia (Fig. ). Ultrasound endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT) (with the fourth layer as the main locus) and a tumor (with the third layer as the main locus), with some areas of indistinct borders (Fig. b). Tissue biopsy of this tumor indicated group 5 tubular adenocarcinoma, and thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor with a mottled contrast stain in the stomach body and no regional lymph nodes or distant metastases (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with collision tumor of gastric cancer and SMT (GIST was highly suspected). Gastrectomy was performed via laparotomy, and the surgical findings were a diagnosis of H0P0CY0 according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Distal gastrectomy was performed with D2 lymph node dissection according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines [].\nThe tumor was located in the greater curvature of the antrum of the stomach and measured 50 \u00d7 45 mm in size (Fig. a). On the cut surface, a nodular tumor was mainly observed in the submucosal layer, and the mucosal surface was ulcerated (Fig. b). A large part of the tumor was observed to be mixed and some of the cancer parts and GIST alone sites were observed. (Fig. c). The nodular tumor was characterized by the intermingled proliferation of carcinoma cells and spindle cells (Fig. d). The spindle cells formed a nodular tumor in the submucosal layer and the subserosal layer. Carcinoma cells invaded the nodular tumor of the spindle cells. Pathological examination revealed Ki67 positive cells comprised 2% of the GIST. The average mitotic count was \u2264 5 mitotic figures per 50 high power fields. GIST was classified as very low risk according to the guidelines for GIST risk stratification []. Tubular adenocarcinoma had reached the subserosa, and no lymph node metastases were observed. The pathological findings were a diagnosis of pT3N0M0 pStageIIA, according to the 3rd English edition of the latest edition of the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma issued by the Japan Gastric Cancer Society []. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a positive reaction for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) in the carcinoma cells (Fig. a). Further, the nuclei of adenocarcinoma cells were positive for TP53 (Fig. b). Although the spindle cells were negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and TP53, these cells were positive for c-kit (Fig. c), weakly positive for DOG-1, and negative for desmin and S-100. As a result, the tumor was diagnosed as a collision tumor of GIST and adenocarcinoma. Lymph node metastasis of GIST or adenocarcinoma was not observed, and the resected margins were negative for neoplastic cells. Histologically, the intratumoral GIST sections contained different KIT exon 17 mutations, and KIT exon 17 mutation corresponding to amino acid substitution Asp820Lys was observed.

On physical examination, his weight was 23 kg (less than 3th percentile), height was 120.4 cm (less than 3th percentile), and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) was 48.5 cm (90th to 95th percentile). He had small deep-set eyes with an apparent hypertelorism, a thin upper lip, a thick and everted lower lip, maxillary micrognathia, and short neck (). He was able to express himself using less than 2 words in incomplete sentences, each made of a word, or repetitive monosyllables. He could not understand demands and these speech-language functions were consistent with the age of 13 months. His cognitive development was uneven, as evidenced by his scores on the Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, which was performed at the age of 10. The verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 36 on arithmetic to 42 on comprehension, and the performance IQ scores ranged from 43 on block design to 47 on coding, with a full-scale IQ of 31. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal and the electrocardiogram revealed an intermittently incomplete atrial-ventricular block. The electroencephalogram showed frequent left central and temporal slow waves (). There were dental anomalies with hypodontia, including all second permanent molars and left mandibular second permanent premolar, and agenesis of all wisdom teeth in a panoramic radiograph (). In addition, delayed eruption of maxillary first permanent molars and poor development of maxillary bones were noticed. His bone age was consistent with his chronological age. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis was performed because of facial dysmorphisms, severe mental retardation, developmental delay, and seizure occurrence.\nHis medical histories are as follows. He was the third child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents, a 34-year-old father and a 31-year-old mother at the time of his birth. His mother did not take any medications during the pregnancy and no prenatal growth retardation was observed. There was no known inherited disorder in the family. He was born at a gestational age of 42+0 weeks by vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 2.9 kg (10th to 25th percentile) and had no perinatal problems. His length was 48 cm (10th to 25th percentile) and his OFC was 32 cm (10th to 25th percentile). His Apgar score was 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes. After birth, he was hospitalized because of poor oral intake and fever. He showed subsequent improvement and was discharged without any problems within the next few days. At the time, the hospital records described that he showed facial dysmorphisms such as small eyes with hypertelorism, open mouth, and pectus excavatum. However, he had no symptoms of muscular hypotonia. Excluding chromosomal analysis, no other abnormalities were identified from the laboratory findings. We reviewed his standard chromosomal analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes, G-banded karyotyping, based on the medical records from the neonatal period. Our analysis revealed that an add(5) was present in all analyzed cells, specifically the 46,XY,add(5)(q31) variant (). However, although a deletion of chromosome 5 at 5q33.3q.35.1 was suspected, unfortunately, it could not be confirmed at that time because of relatively low resolution of G-banded karyotyping. Ultrasonography of the brain revealed the presence of small bilateral cysts in the choroid plexus. A small-sized patent ductus arteriosus was detected in the echocardiogram; however, it was found to have closed spontaneously during follow-up visits. Nuss operation for pectus excavatum was performed at 4 years of age because he intermittently suffered from respiratory discomfort. He also had a follow-up visit for subclinical hypothyroidism.\nAt 6 months of age, a gradual delay in global development was noticed. For example, he could sit up by the age of 10 months and walk at 3 years. Until 1 year of age, he showed no response in brain stem audiometry. Speech development was also delayed; he started uttering single words only when he turned 4 years old. His first epileptic seizure occurred with fever when he was 3 years old and was first erroneously interpreted as febrile convulsion. Later, the recurrent nature of these seizures became apparent until the age of 8. After treatment with antiepileptic medications, the patient reached a seizure-free state. Magnetic resonance imaging at 8 years of age showed unremarkable findings.\nThe parents provided a formal informed consent that permitted the use of peripheral blood sampling and genetic testing. We performed high-resolution CMA analysis to specify the breakpoint. The genomic DNA was analyzed using a Cytoscan 750K array and the chromosome analysis suite software package (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) using genome build Hg19. The results showed a 16-Mb deletion of 5q33.3q35.11 and an array aberration with 5q33.3q35.1(156,409,412-172,584,708)x1 (). His parents had apparently normal chromosomes. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed as having a de novo deletion in the 5q33.3q35.1 chromosome.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n63.0", "task": "calc"}

From May 31, 2011, injection of 80 mL of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (usually used to lower serum transaminase, 2\u20133 times a week) was carried out until the end of August 2019.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) was carried out on February 10, 2011, which showed unevenness of the surface of the liver with splenomegaly, and she was diagnosed with a cirrhotic state. For eradication of HCV, PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy was performed from August 5 to December 5, 2012, but it was not effective. Thereafter, CT performed on February 6, 2018, showed ascites and pleural effusion (Fig. ) and she was diagnosed with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Furosemide and Aldactone A were administered, but pleural effusion and ascites remained. For the low albumin level, albumin infusion was carried out from March 22, 2016, to August 30, 2019 (every 2 weeks).\nOn August 3, 2019, a new DAA drug, SOF (NS5B inhibitor, 400 mg)/VEL (NS5A inhibitor, 100 mg), was administered until October 25, 2019 (about 12 weeks). HCV-RNA became negative on August 30, 2019. Abdominal CT performed on September 25 showed neither ascites nor pleural effusion (Fig. ).\nHepatic encephalopathy (grade I\u2013II), which appeared on July 23, 2019 (the patient claimed cloudiness of sensation, serum ammonia level of 112 \u03bcg/dL), disappeared on October 7, 2019 (serum ammonia level of 85 \u03bcg/dL) (Fig. ). She stated that her consciousness was cloudy and it took many hours for the preparation of each meal just before the SOF/VEL treatment, but after the disappearance of HCV-RNA by the therapy, her consciousness became clear and she could prepare a meal in a short time. Furthermore, she also stated that the sensation of fatigue had disappeared, and it had become easier to move by the 6th week of administration of the drugs. In addition, she also showed marked improvements in the albumin level (Fig. ) and in prothrombin time (Fig. ).

She developed clinical signs of puberty at 12 years old (thelarche -11 years old, pubarche - 12 years old) and she became sexually active at 14 years. She had two previous surgical interventions, an appendectomy and an exploratory laparotomy. The physical exam noted an average stature and body mass index (165cm in height, 66 kilos in weight), normal developed breast (Tanner 5) (Fig .a) and normal body hair distribution, including arm span, pubic and axillary hair (Fig .b.c). The clinic examination revealed normal clitoris, labia major and minor, and a short (2 cm) vagina, that ended in a blind pouch (Fig .d).\nThe US exam (Voluson Pro 730 GE Medical Systems, Zipf, Austria machine, equipped with 4-8-MHz and 5-9 MHz curvilinear transducers) found an ectopic right solitary kidney (with mild pyelectasis), located in the right low quadrant of the abdomen, and failed to identify the uterus and ovaries using both transabdominal and transvaginal approach (Fig .a.b).\nDue to the discordance between the clinical and laboratory findings (normal complete sexualisation, normal hormones) and ultrasound features (absent ovaries) we considered these findings incomplete. Thus, we performed MRI, which revealed normal liver, pancreas, confirmed the right solitary ectopic kidney and the absence of uterus, but failed to visualize any tubal remnants and the ovaries.\nBlood routine and renal function were in normal limits. Hormone profile included measurement of follicular stimulating hormone (4.3mUI/ml), estradiol (840pmol/l) and testosterone (1.59 nmol/l), which were all normal, indicating normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.\nClassic G banding is the elective genetic method used to differentiate the Mayer- Rokitansy-Kuster-Hauser syndrome from other genital tract development defects such as Turner syndrome (45, 0X) and androgen insensitivity syndrome (46, XY). The karyotype was normal (46, XX).\nThe cardiologic exam (ECG and echocardiogram) showed normal heart functionality with no evidence of morphological anomalies and the chest X-ray was also normal. Intravenous pyelography showed left renal agenesis, right hypertrophic kidney in ectopic ilio-pelvic position, with normal secretion and excretion function and normal urinary bladder (Fig .c).\nAfter counselling, informed consent for laparoscopic exploration was obtained, in order to locate and describe the internal genitals. Laparoscopy confirmed normal urinary bladder, absent uterus (Fig .a), left renal agenesis and a right ectopic kidney (Fig .b). Both ovaries were found in an ectopic high position, in the right and left superior quadrants, with adjacent small fallopian tubes. The right ovary had a normal aspect (Fig .d) and the left ovary presented a haemorrhagic cyst that was removed (Fig .c). Complete inspection of the peritoneal cavity showed a congestive cecal appendix, also removed. After acknowledging the topography of the ovaries, we were able to identify them on later US scans (Fig .d). There were no postoperative complications and the patient was discharged after 3 days. Before discharge, another ultrasonographic evaluation was performed and revealed both high positioned ectopic ovaries.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nIn May 2009, a 30-year-old woman came to the emergency room (ER) with a five-day history of acute progressive dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class III). In 2007, ductal carcinoma in situ was diagnosed by biopsy during pregnancy. In 2008, after a full-term delivery, findings on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound of the right breast revealed diffuse microcalcification and skin thickening of the right breast, and metastatic axillary lymph nodes. The patient refused further management and was lost to follow up until the ER visit.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 126/76 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats per min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 36.7\u2103. A chest radiograph showed that the lung field was clear. Results of arterial blood gas analysis in room air indicated hypoxemia: pH 7.446, pCO2 28.2 mm Hg, pO2 44.3 mm Hg, HCO3 19.1 mmol/L, SaO2 76.8%. D-dimers were elevated to 2.59 \u00b5g/mL (normal, <0.39 \u00b5g/mL) with an elevated troponin I level to 0.24 ng/mL (normal, <0.04 ng/mL) and a brain natriuretic peptide of 774 pg/mL (normal, <100 pg/mL). Diffuse enlargement of the right breast with skin thickening and many enlarged axillary lymph nodes consistent with locally advanced breast cancer was observed on CT.\nOn the second day of admission, the patient was consulted with the cardiology department for possible preoperative cardiac evaluation. An electrocardiogram showed an S1Q3T3 pattern with inverted or flattened T waves in leads V1 through V4. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with right ventricular enlargement and free wall hypokinesia sparing the apex. In addition, the echocardiogram showed typical findings of acute pulmonary thromboembolism with a D-shaped left ventricle, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 61 mm Hg.\nOther laboratory tests showed the following results: white blood cell 7,900/mm3 with normal differential counts, hemoglobin15.4 g/dL, platelets 144,000/mm3, alanine aminotransferase 50 IU/L (normal, 0 to 40 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase 218 IU/L (normal, 0 to 40 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dL), C-reactive protein 0.81 mg/dL (normal, 0 to 0.30 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.36 (normal, 0.8 to 1.2), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 45.7 seconds (normal, 27.0 to 45.0 seconds), fibrinogen of 196 mg/dL (normal, 200 to 400 mg/dL), and fibrin degradation products (FDP) of 1 : 2 positive (normal, negative). A peripheral blood smear showed increased numbers of schistocytes and reticulocytes consistent with MAHA ().\nWe measured serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in view of preexisting information on VEGF, a critical angiogenic molecule and IL-6, a multifunctional cytokine promoting tumor growth. Serum VEGF levels were 26.9 pg/mL on the second day in the hospital and 9.5 pg/mL on the third day in the hospital (normal, 88.7 to 1,048.7 pg/mL); IL-6 levels were 50.3 pg/mL and 25.6 pg/mL on the second and third days, respectively (normal range, 0.4 to 8.6 pg/mL).\nAnticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was startedunder the clinical diagnosis of submassive acute pulmonary thromboembolism. While no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism was observed on pulmonary CT angiography (), an echocardiogram showed acute right ventricular pressure overload (), and a perfusion lung scan showed multiple small wedge-shaped perfusion defects throughout both lungs (). Therefore, with a diagnosis of PTTM based on clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and received 1 mg/kg enoxaparin subcutaneously, 0.05 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenously, and 2 mg warfarin sodium orally.\nOn the third day of admission, repeated transthoracic echocardiogram showed additional significant right ventricular pressure overload with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg. Abnormal liver function was the result of either passive congestion or hepatic metastasis, although the initial CT did not show definite systemic metastasis.

She had undergone bilateral breast augmentation surgery with silicone bags 5 years previously, with resurgery on the right side due to bag rupture 7 months before presentation. Seven days before admission, she became febrile and noticed dyspnea. She visited her family doctor and was diagnosed with pneumonia, but treatment with antibiotic therapy had no noticeable effect. She was then referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment.\nThe patient was 158 cm tall, weighed 46 kg, and blood pressure was 100/50 mmHg, heart rate was 74 beats/min, body temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min on admission. Inspiratory rales were heard at both lung bases.\nThe examination of the blood revealed severe thrombocytopenia with prolonged prothrombin time and high levels of fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) (). Chemical analysis revealed severe abnormal liver function with jaundice, mild renal insufficiency, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Arterial blood gas levels on room air revealed hypoxemia with hypocapnia. All testing for autoantibodies yielded negative results. Blood culture was negative for bacteria. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed nodular and macular shadowing in the right upper and middle lobes and left inferior lobe and ground-glass opacities in both inferior lobes (). Our patient saw an ophthalmologist, and there were no findings suggestive of uveitis.\nWe diagnosed interstitial pneumonia with hepatic dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and initiated methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1 g/day for 3 consecutive days) for interstitial pneumonia and gabexate mesilate and antithrombin III for DIC. Antibiotic (Meropenem trihydrate 1 g/day, Azithromycin hydrate 500 mg/day) was administrated to cover the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia. On day 4, respiratory status and interstitial opacity on CT were improved (). However, fever recurred on day 10 and respiratory status and CT findings were deteriorated on day 15 (). Methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 consecutive days) was again administered, followed by prednisolone (40 mg/day) to avoid recurring exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia. On day 18, bronchoscopy was performed to identify the cause of interstitial pneumonia. Transbronchial lung biopsy specimens revealed small cell infiltrations of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed an increased number of lymphocytes (52.5%) and a high CD4/CD8 ratio (2.52). However, the cause of interstitial pneumonia remained unclear. Ziehl-Neelsen staining of tissue samples and sputum culture yielded negative results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Fever recurred on day 20 and liver biopsy was performed to identify the cause of fever. We considered the possibility of sarcoidosis based on elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (63.0 IU/L) and lysozyme (11.8 mg/mL). On day 23, Liver biopsy confirmed Langhans' giant cell and noncaseating granuloma (). On day 34, CT was performed to followup the interstitial pneumonia and fever, revealing miliary nodules in both lung fields, typical of miliary tuberculosis, although interstitial shadows had disappeared (). On day 35, antituberculosis therapy (isoniazid, 300 mg/day; rifampicin, 450 mg/day; ethambutol, 750 mg/day; pyrazinamide, 1200 mg/day) was applied for miliary tuberculosis after acid-fast bacilli were detected in gastric fluid and sputum, and polymerase chain reaction testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis yielded positive results. Ziehl-Neelsen staining obtained positive results in a liver specimen (), but negative results in a lung specimen. Fever subsided following antituberculosis therapy. On day 41, rifampicin was stopped due to leukocytopenia (while blood cell (WBC) count, 1550/mm3; neutrophils, 350/mm3), likely caused by rifampicin. On day 59, the WBC count was fully recovered, and rifampicin was restarted at a low dose (150 mg). Fever was again seen on day 64, and CT was performed on day 68. Although miliary nodules in both lung fields had almost disappeared (), sickly shadowing was newly apparent in both upper lobes (). These new lesions were considered highly likely to represent recurrent interstitial pneumonia and not exacerbation of miliary tuberculosis, because exacerbation occurred during treatment for tuberculosis. On day 68, methylprednisolone was restarted at 0.5 g/day for 3 days and the dose of prednisolone was increased to 40 mg/day. Thereafter, fever subsided and the sickly shadowing had disappeared by day 72 (). On day 70, we switched from rifampicin to levofloxacin, as leucopenia had again progressed. Prednisolone was gradually tapered to 30 mg/day, and the patient was discharged without recurrence of the disease on day 100 ().\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n50.571", "task": "calc"}

Both his parents were Javanese, normal, non-consanguineous, and in their sixth decade of life. He was the third child born after a normal third pregnancy and he had two sisters who were normal. His mother had a cesarean delivery with no history of trauma, infection, or drug use during the term. No family history of similar complaints or any other congenital abnormality was reported. Our patient was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy.\nHe is a slow learner and attends a school for children with special needs in Cirebon, West Java, Indonesia. There he began to socialize, play with other classmates, and he likes to draw and enjoys music. The dysmorphisms found are very characteristic. On physical examination, his weight was 36 kg, height 158 cm, and occipital frontal circumference 54 cm. It was observed that he displayed hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissure, strabismus, ocular proptosis, depressed nasal bridge, short philtrum, and low-set ears. In addition, acrocephaly, asymmetrical flat facies, nasal deformity, and prominent jaw were present (Fig. ). His oral deformities showed maxilla hypoplasia with high arch palate. His V-shaped maxillary arch was filled with double rows of teeth. In addition, there was a dental fusion between maxillary premolar and first molar. Panoramic radiographs were performed for confirmation (Fig. ). Other abnormalities found were mild scoliosis and mild pectus excavatum. Symmetrical cutaneous bilateral syndactyly involving his four fingers, his palms were spoon-shaped with an inwardly placed thumb, was present (type 2). Both feet showed type 2 symmetrical cutaneous syndactyly of the first to fifth toes. Radiographs of both hands and feet confirmed soft tissue syndactyly (Fig. ). He had corrective surgery twice on both hands to correct for joint contractures. There was no postoperative complication. Six months after the second surgery, he could start using his fingers. A clinical diagnosis of AS was previously made based on these clinical features, as earlier mentioned in our study describing clinical manifestations of this patient []. Furthermore, Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations (POSSUM) software () was used before molecular analysis and the result showed suspected AS with a cut-off point of 14. Ethical clearance for genetic testing was obtained according to the research ethic committee of Faculty of Medicine, Swadaya Gunung Jati University, Indonesia.\nMutation analysis was conducted for our patient. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using the salt saturation method, as previously described by Miller et al. []. Molecular genetics analysis of FGFR2, targeting exon 7, was performed by direct sequencing at the Laboratory of Neurovascular Unit and Cognitive Impairments, University of Poitiers, France. The reference genomic DNA sequence used was NM_000141.4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exon 7 from the FGFR2 gene was performed using the primers FGFR2-F 5-CCGGCAGTCTCCTTTGAAGT-3\u2032 and FGFR2-R 5\u2032-GATCTGTTAATTCCTTAGAACACTCTCT-3\u2032, resulting in a 525 bp fragment. Approximately 50 ng of DNA solution (2.5 \u03bcl) was added to 22.5 \u03bcl of PCR mixture. This PCR mixture contained 0.25 \u03bcl of 25 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 3 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.25 \u03bcl of each 20 \u03bcM primer, 2.5 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer, 0.125 \u03bcl of 5 U/\u03bcl Diamond\u00ae high fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Eurogentec), and 16.13 \u03bcl of H2O. PCR was initiated with denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 PCR cycles (at 95 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 seconds) and 7 minutes final elongation at 72 \u00b0C. The amplified products were detected by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light. Furthermore, 5 \u03bcl of the PCR product was cleaned up with 2 \u03bcl ExoSAP reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, to remove excess primers and unincorporated nucleotides enzymatically. Finally, 2 \u03bcl of the PCR product was used for the sequence reaction (BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit Version 3.3; Applied Biosystems), which was run on an ABI PRISM\u00ae 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Sequencing was performed bidirectionally using the forward and reverse PCR primers. The sequence result was compared with the published reference sequence using Chromas software version 2.6.4.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nOur case involved a 32 year-old woman affected by CF diagnosed at 6 months old, with renal diseases and hypertension in her family medical history. She also suffered from reactive arthritis since 19 years old in steroid and hydroxychloroquine therapy and had been diagnosed with CF-related diabetes at the age of 21.\nAfter a fever episode (treated with ciprofloxacin) in October 2015 the patient\u2019s laboratory tests showed Haemoglobin 8.2 mg/dl, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 62 ml/min, hypocomplementemia C3. Her urinalysis pointed out hematuria (10\u201320 RBC/field of view) with 60% of dysmorphic erythrocytes, without proteinuria. The first clinical suspicion was a post-infectious glomerulonephritis. After that, a close follow up was conducted until December 2015. The persistent laboratory results over 8 weeks required kidney biopsy to be performed to exclude other causes of nephritic syndrome.\nLight microscopy pointed out 5 sclerotic glomeruli out of 23. Main pattern was diffuse endocapillary proliferation, segmental in only a few glomeruli, with neutrophil (and less frequently lympho-monocyte) infiltration. Mesangium was characterized by deposits as well as hypercellularity and increased mesangial matrix. Interstitium showed mild edema and inflammatory cells, as well as between Tubular Basement Membrane and the above cells. A few arteries presented a fibrous intimal thickening. Arteriolar hyalinosis manifested too (Fig. and ).\nImmunofluorescence assay proved strong C3 staining (3+) in granular deposits in mesangium and glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Staining was less evident in tubuli (2+). IgA staining was focal in mesangium and in only a few arteriolar walls (2+). The presence of IgG only into tubular cells was explained as the result of re-absorption (Fig. ).\nThe deposits were well characterized by electron microscopy. They were localized to a greater extent in mesangium, but the assay demonstrated their presence also in subendothelial and subepithelial spaces. Their confluent electrondense appearance, instead of the intensely osmiophilic ribbon-shaped deposits pathognomonic for DDD, allowed to conclude for a C3 glomerulonephritis (Fig. and ).\nComplement system dysregulation was tested and resulted in a strong terminal pathway activation proved by high levels of sC5b-9 complex, amounting to 1588 ng/ml (normal value < 400 ng/ml).\nBoth genetics and C3NeF were investigated to determine the etiology of this altered control of alternative pathway. Next generation sequencing (NGS) showed polymorphism in CFH (p.V62I in SCR1) and THBD (p.A473V) already known as pathogenic for C3GN, as well as a mutation in C3 (p.R102G) associated only with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) so far.4\nOur patient is now treated with Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) added to her current Cystic Fybrosis and Reactive Arthritis therapies to preserve her kidney function.\nAfter two years of disease her renal function is stable with serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 50 ml/min, 24 h proteinuria 270 mg, hypocomplementemia for C3 (14 mg/dl) and haemoglobin 9.4 mg/dl.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n40.608", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 43-years-old Caucasian male (height 198 cm, weight 115 kg, tobacco smoker \u2013 1 packet of cigarettes/day) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from a municipal hospital because of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome associated with infection and necrosis of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the left lower leg. The signs and symptoms of the disease \u2013 edema and pain affecting the left leg-began 7 days before admission. The patient's medical history was significant for hepatitis C (HCV), treated with ribavarin and interferon, and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. On the day of admission the HCV-RNA test was negative. A mosquito bite was the probable triggering event.\nOn admission to the ICU the patient was confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9. He was afebrile, had tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, hypotension, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and relative respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation of 88% \u2013 90%). He had moderately-dilated pupils with a delayed light reflex. We noted crepitus over the bilateral lung fields, a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and oliguria. There were numerous hemorrhagic extravasations on the skin. Examination of the left leg revealed diffuse edema of the skin, with marked erythema and necrosis; margins of infection were sharply demarcated, spreading onto the buttock and perineum on the left side (Figure ). Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, with the following values: base excess -15 mmol/l, lactate level 7.3 mmol/l, PaO2 64 mmHg, platelet count 29,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.24, serum creatinine 691.6 \u03bcmol/l, bilirubin 62.6 \u03bcmol/l, and C-reactive Protein (CRP) 224.6 \u03bcg/dl.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of admission was 31 points and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 18 points. The patient required fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation in BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) mode, continuous intravenous infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and low doses of steroids to restore blood pressure. After obtaining cultures from the affected tissue, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in appropriate media, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately administered (meropenem 3 g/day in a 3-h infusion, vancomycin 3 g/day in continuous infusion, metronidazole 1.5/day in 3 divided doses). Because of progressive organ dysfunction, therapy was started with activated protein C, in doses of 24 \u03bcg/kg/h; continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was also started. After several hours, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute and his blood pressure decreased to 80/50 mmHg. Electrical cardioversion was performed three times, followed by continuous infusion of cordarone (12 mg/kg/day). During this time, intensive fluid resuscitation was administered. During the first day, the patient received 12,800 ml of fluid (colloids and crystalloids). His unstable condition did not allow for early surgical management.\nThe cultures from the affected areas of skin contained Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus sciuri. Based on sensitivity results, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and penicillin G was started at a dose of 60 million units a day (intravenous) in 6 divided doses. Because the patient's poor condition persisted and the microbes were sensitive to clindamycin, it was added at 2.7 g/day in 3 divided doses. In spite of the lack of information about G-pathogens, meropenem was continued. The patient also received 40 g of commercially available gamma-globulin (intravenous), 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets. After several days his condition improved, with urine output of 100\u2013150 ml/h and resolution of his metabolic acidosis. On the sixth day, the patient's hemodynamic parameters deteriorated again, with tachycardia to 160 beats per minute and a decrease in blood pressure to 85/60 mmHg. CVVH was administered again for detoxification. On the seventh day, the necrotic tissue was surgically excised (Figures , ). We also noted a progressive decline in the white blood cell count to 2,200/mm3, and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor.\nCultures of the BAL showed 104 colony-forming units/ml of methycillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (The patient had been a carrier of methycillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] isolated from his nose vestibule on admission.) Because MRSA also was present in blood cultures and the patient's condition remained poor, linezolid 1.2 g a day in 2 divided doses was initiated based on additional results of susceptibility tests. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and we discontinued mechanical ventilation. 25 days after admission the patient was discharged to the trauma surgery ward for plastic reconstruction of his wounds.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 61-year-old female presents with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery (RCA) with a bare metal stent (BMS) in 2004 on a background of treated hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and smoking. Her regular medications were aspirin 81 mg OD, metoprolol 25 mg BID, ramipril 5 mg OD and atorvastatin 40 mg OD. Since admission, she had ongoing chest pain. Her ECG had lateral ST-T changes and the peak cTnI was 3.0 ng/mL. She was brought emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The procedure was completed via right transradial catheterization. Coronary angiography showed diffusely diseased left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with a 70% stenosis in the mid third with an occluded first obtuse marginal coronary artery (OM1) with TIMI 0 flow (). The RCA was anterior in origin and nonselective coronary injection showed a patent stent (). The OM1 was considered to be the culprit vessel and attempted to cross with Pilot 50 wire (Guidant Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA). The wire crossed the proximal subsection of the left circumflex (LCX) with support (Abbott TREK 2.0 mm \u00d7 15 mm coronary dilatation catheter) (). There was a resultant type B coronary dissection of the mid subsection of the proximal LCX. A Wizdom Supersoft wire (Cordis Corp., Miami, FL, USA) was used to cross the dissection plane as a \u201cparallel wire technique\u201d to deal with the wire-induced dissection []. The proximal LCX was predilated with the 2.0 mm \u00d7 15 mm coronary dilation catheter to seal the proximal LCX dissection plane. Once flow was reestablished, the Pilot 50 wire and the 2.0 mm \u00d7 15 mm coronary dilation catheter were removed. The Wizdom Supersoft wire was used to advance down the OM1. A secondary type B coronary dissection was noted in the mid subsection of the mid third of the OM1 (). The proximal LCX dissection plane appeared to have reduced flow and the dissection plane was again sealed with multiple balloon inflations. The patient remained pain-free with stable hemodynamics. The proximal LCX dissection plane appeared stable with TIMI 3 flow. Given the stable situation, the decision was made to stop. IV Eptifibatide infusion was started to stabilize the dissection plane with a plan to reattempt the CTO in 72 hours (). The second procedure was also completed successfully via right transradial catheterization. Selective left coronary angiography showed a coronary artery (LCX) to coronary sinus fistula (). The proximal LCX and the mid OM1 dissection planes appeared stable. As the patient remained pain-free and hemodynamically stable for 72 hours, the decision to manage medically with repeat noninvasive testing in 6\u20138 weeks was made. If there was evidence of reversible ischemia in the LCX territory (coronary steal syndrome), the decision would be to close the coronary AV fistula. Stress echocardiogram in 8 weeks showed no evidence of reversible ischemia in the LCX territory. The patient was advised to stay compliant with her current medications, continue dual antiplatelet therapy for a year, and make strong efforts to quit smoking.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?", "output": "### Response:\n7", "task": "calc"}

Her past medical history was hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and she was on multiple medications. She had been anorexic for ~1 month. She was an ex-smoker and a social drinker.\nOn admission, her mental status was recovered and her conscious levels were E4V5M6 (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)). Her physical findings and vital signs were as follows: height 139.0 cm, body weight 52.3 kg, body mass index 27.1 kg/m2, blood pressure 128/75 mmHg, heart rate 152 beats/min with irregularity, body temperature 36.8\u00b0C, oxygen saturation on room air 98% and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Her physical examinations, which included her conjunctiva, cervical lymph nodes, chest, heart and abdomen, revealed normal findings.\nBaseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) 10 300/\u03bcL\u2191, hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL\u2191, creatinine 4.09 mg/dL\u2191, sodium 128 mEq/L\u2193, potassium 2.6 mEq/L\u2193, chlorides 87 mEq/L\u2193, total protein 7.1 g/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.07 mg/dL, glucose 262 mg/dL\u2191 and \u03b2-glycated hemoglobin 5.9%. Urinalysis revealed protein (1+), sugar (4+) and ketones (+) with no blood cells or casts. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, but there were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph or on brain or thoracicoabdominal computed tomography (CT).\nThese findings suggested that her AMS might be caused by one or more conditions, namely, hyponatremia, ketonuria, hyperglycemia and acute kidney injury (uremia), which were presumably due to dehydration, diabetic ketosis and chronic kidney disease. She was hospitalized and treated with electrolytes, including sodium chloride and potassium chloride, and insulin.\nAlthough her blood electrolytes, serum glucose and renal function gradually improved, general conditions, including her consciousness, deteriorated. On the third day after hospitalization, her cognitive function became impaired with reduced conscious levels to E4V3M4 (GCS). Abnormal breaths with apnea and tachypnea accompanied by a fever (37.8\u00b0C) appeared, and glossoptosis was found (Fig. ). Both an oropharyngeal airway and bite block were placed in order to maintain her airway, which is we realized that she suffered from multiple, painful dental caries, but no findings of within the oropharynx.\nLaboratory results on the hospital Day 3 were as follows: WBC 14 800/\u03bcL with 94.1% neutrophils\u2191 and CRP 0.08 mg/dL. There were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph, brain or thoracicoabdominal CT, brain magnetic resonance imaging, or spinal fluid examination.\nBecause no abnormalities were detected in the central nervous system, empiric treatment was initiated with 2.25 g q6hr of piperacillin/tazobactam for fever of unknown origin presumably caused by bacterial infection(s).\nOn hospital Day 6, a dentist examined her teeth and found 15 dental caries, then dental extractions were performed on four teeth. In particular, pus was discharged from the left upper canine with gingival swelling, which was diagnosed with acute apical abscess.\nOn hospital Day 7, her mental status was completely normal (Fig. ), indicating that apical abscess was acute, severe inflammation of the dental pulp with minimal chance of spontaneous recovery [\u2013] and may have caused her AMS and abnormal breathing. Although two sets of blood cultures sampled on hospital Day 3 were negative, bacterial culture from the dental pus sampled on hospital Day 6 yielded methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to 1 g q8hr of cefazolin on hospital Day 13 and was completed on hospital Day 20.

She did not exhibit any signs suggestive of Graves' ophthalmopathy, including conjunctival injection, periorbital edema, or proptosis.\nThe laboratory data were as follows: AST = 46 IU/L (range, 11\u201328), ALT = 54 IU/L (range, 7\u201323), ALP = 352 IU/L (range, 115\u2013330), \u03b3GTP = 18 IU/L (range, 9\u201327), TSH = <0.005 \u03bcIU/mL (range, 0.2\u20134.0), free thyroxine = 2.66 ng/dL (range, 1.00\u20132.00), free triiodothyronine = 11.35 pg/mL (range, 2.30\u20134.00), and negative thyroid autoantibodies, including negative TRAb, negative anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb), and negative anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). Thyroid autoantibodies were tested twice, with negative results both times. TSH receptor stimulating antibodies (TSAb), as assessed on a bioassay, were also negative.\nUltrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a tumor in the right lobe () measuring 21.5 mm \u00d7 19.4 mm \u00d7 36.3 mm in diameter. The lesion had a relatively low echoic appearance and sharp border. No areas of microcalcification were detected in the tumor, although areas of macrocalcification were present. The remaining thyroid gland had an inhomogeneous, rough texture with a high color Doppler flow (). I123 scintigraphy was performed following iodine restriction for one week prior to the study, revealing a hot nodule in the lower right thyroid gland corresponding to the tumor detected on ultrasonography (). The total uptake percentage of I123 for four hours was approximately 24% (range: 4\u201316%). Surprisingly, there was an increased uptake of radionuclide in the remaining thyroid gland despite the suppressed level of TSH and negative TRAb titer, suggesting underlying Graves' disease.\nThioamides, which are commonly used to treat Graves' disease in Japan, have the well-known side effect of hepatotoxicity [, ]. Because the patient displayed elevated liver enzymes due to her untreated hepatitis C, we administered 10 mCi of radioiodine instead of thioamides. After the treatment, her subjective ambiguous chest discomfort, possibly due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was ameliorated. Thyroid function test results on a regular visit conducted one month after the radioiodine treatment were as follows: TSH = <0.005 \u03bcIU/mL (range, 0.2\u20134.0), free thyroxine = 1.40 ng/dL (range, 1.00\u20132.00), and free triiodothyronine = 4.91 pg/mL (range, 2.30\u20134.00). Her hyperthyroidism was successfully improved one month after the administration of the radioisotope and no episodes of recurrence have since been observed.\n\nWhat is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "output": "### Response:\n4", "task": "calc"}

Diagnosed with PNET with multiple liver metastases at another hospital, she was transferred to our clinic for bloodless surgery owing to the patient's religious faith. The patient's height was 152 cm and weight was 53.6 kg. She didn't have any other underlying medical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, tuberculosis and so on. Physical exams revealed mildly distended abdomen and a non-tender palpable intraabdominal mass. The serum tumor markers including CEA, CA 19-9, and \u03b1-FP were within normal limits, whereas liver function test levels including total bilirubin (1.3 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase (58 U/L), and alanine transaminase (49 U/L) were slightly elevated. Radiological tools including abdominal-pelvic CT scan, biliary and pancreas dynamic MRI with contrast, PET/CT scan, and bone scan contributed to diagnosis and therapeutic plan. According to the results of radiological imaging studies, a huge well capsulated tumor (about 8-cm diameter on the longest distance) was located in the pancreatic body and tail, which was highly enhanced by the contrast material. Multiple hepatic metastases were found in both lobes ().\nSono-guided biopsies on liver and pancreas showed proliferation of uniform round cells in ribbon, consistent with metastatic well-differentiated PNET from the pancreas. Results revealed positive staining of chromogranin A and cytokeratin (CK). Ki67 labeling index was about 4%-5% that corresponded to grade 2. For treatment of PNET with multiple liver metastases, serial therapies were scheduled. First of all, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed prior to surgery. The interventional radiologist performed TACE with mitomycin and lipiolol, which were injected to the patient's metastatic hepatic tumors. After a total of 3 sessions of successful TACE for multiple liver metastases over 4 months (), the size of multiple liver metastases decreased dramatically in the following abdomen CT (). Meanwhile, the patient suffered from liver failure with total bilirubin increased up to 23 mg/dL. Careful conservative management without transfusion was carried out for treatment of liver impairment. For the systemic treatment, octreotide acetate injection was given before surgery. Initial dose was 0.1 mg via subcutaneous injection every 8 hours over 3 days for response test, and then 4 injections at 20 mg were given daily via intramuscular route per 28 days.\nThe attending surgeon and anesthesiologist discussed the risks of bloodless major operations. The patient signed a consent form for the operation without the use of blood products. She allowed albumin and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH). Considering that it was a cancer surgery, Cell Saver was not allowed due to risk of shed cancer cells. The preoperative albumin level was 3.7 g/dL, hemoglobin was 12.6 mg/dL, and hematocrit was 36.8%. The dissection of RAMPS procedure started from the left side, which is the neck of the pancreas, to the right side with splenic vessels and celiac node dissection. Afterwards, the plane of dissection proceeded posteriorly in a sagittal plane along the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery down to the level of the aorta, in sequence, going on laterally to the left adrenal gland (). There was severe adhesion of omentum to the hepatic tumors and pancreatic tumor, however, the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery were relatively well isolated from the tumor. The pancreatic tumor was well vascularized, capsulated, and abutted to the renal arteries and veins, but not invading (). Histological diagnosis was consistent with well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with negative resection margin but extending to the peripancreatic soft tissue and splenic venous wall. It showed angioinvasion and neural invasion containing ischemic necrosis. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that chromogranin A, CD56, CD10, and CK were positive (). Pathologic staging was T3N0M1 stage IV according to American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging for pancreatic tumors.\nTotal operative time was 4 hours 30 minutes. Estimated blood loss was 800 mL and while the patient received 3 pints of ANH and intravenous dextran during the operation. The postoperative albumin was 2.8 g/dL, hemoglobin 11.5 mg/dL, hematocrit 33.8%, and fibrinogen 248 mg/dL. As an assistant therapy for a transfusion free patient, recombinant human erythropoietin 4,000 IU and 1 ample of iron hydroxide sucrose complex were given daily for five days after surgery. Postoperative abdominal CT scan didn't show any evidence of pancreatic fistula or fluid collections around the pancreatic resection margin.\nThe patient took a sip of water on day 2 and began a soft diet on day 4, postoperatively.

At this time, he had an oxygen saturation of 92% at room air, which improved to 97% with a 3 L nasal cannula. A chest radiograph showed evidence of a new right-sided spontaneous pneumothorax (Figure ), which was also demonstrated on CT chest with IV contrast (Figure ).\nA right-sided chest tube was placed for the treatment of the right-sided pneumothorax (Figure ).\nDaily chest radiographs were obtained to monitor the status of the pneumothorax. It continued to enlarge secondary to subsequent malpositioning of the chest tube. At this time, interventional radiology was consulted. A pigtail catheter was placed and the malpositioned chest tube was removed (Figure ).\nFollowing pigtail catheter placement, the pneumothorax resolved within a week, and the catheter was removed without complications. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated the resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient\u2019s oxygen saturation improved to 98% on room air.\nAmikacin was changed from IV administration to the inhaled formulation to avoid nephrotoxicity on discharge. The patient was additionally sent home with voriconazole, azithromycin, and ethambutol.

History showed that the patient visited our department of gastroenterology with chief complaints of blackish feces and ill complexion in February 1997. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy was used to treat duodenal ulcer bleeding. Computed tomography (CT) showed a right retroperitoneal tumor, which was removed in the same month.\nHistopathological examination showed a teratoma and yolk sac tumor (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with primary retroperitoneal EGCT and underwent three courses of chemotherapy (bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin; BEP) starting in May 1997. He was closely followed using procedures including periodic imaging, tumor markers determination, and self-palpation.\nHe was followed up on an outpatient basis 5 years after treatment and was subsequently lost to follow-up. In August 1999, he underwent surgery of the right hydrocele. At that time, perioperative findings were unremarkable, indicating no clear tumor in either testicle.\nAt the first visit, his height was found to be 163 cm, and weight was 58.5 kg.\nBlood pressure was 128/78 mmHg, heart rate was regular at 62 beats per minute, and body temperature was 36.4 \u00b0C.\nHe had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing remarkable in the family history.\nOn physical examination, the right testicle was found to be elastic, hard, and enlarged to the size of 40 \u00d7 40 mm. A 45 \u00d7 40 mm sized induration was palpable in the right inguinal area and was adequately mobile. Neurological examination showed no abnormal findings. Blood biochemistry examination, urinalysis, and tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) showed no abnormal findings.\nUltrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle, with no abnormal findings in the left testicle.\nDuring other diagnostic imaging procedures, enlargements of the right external iliac lymph node (24 \u00d7 14 mm) and right inguinal lymph node (43 \u00d7 29 mm) and a 31 \u00d7 22 mm mass with uneven contents were found in the right testicle (Fig. ). There was no evidence of any distant metastasis.\nFor the right testicular tumor, the patient underwent high orchiectomy and resection of the right inguinal lymph nodes in November 2017. The testicular tumor was 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 30 mm in size and weighed 34 g. The lymph node was 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 30 mm in size and weighed 21 g. The cut surfaces of both specimens were yellowish and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle (Fig. ).\nHistopathological findings showed irregular cobblestone proliferations of germ cell-like atypical cells with clear nucleoli and massive necrotic changes that partially resulted from self-destruction. The tumor did not extend into the tunica albuginea, and no vascular infiltration was found. Spermatic cord stumps were negative. Tumor diagnosis was a classical seminoma with no other elements. Lymph node metastases were also diagnosed as a result of the seminoma (Fig. ).\nBased on the above findings, this seminoma was diagnosed as pT1, pN2, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIB [].\nThe patient received postoperative chemotherapy with one course of BEP therapy and three courses of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) therapy at the Japan Community Health care Organization Kani Tono Hospital starting in January 2018.\nPost-chemotherapy CT confirmed a complete clinical response (cCR) at the right external iliac lymph node, and this response continued 12 months later (Fig. ).\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and weight loss of 8 kg over the previous two months. The patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 57 kg. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse was 110 beats/min. She was on no diuretics or other medications. She did not have a medical history or diarrhea upon presentation. On admission, she had weakness in both limbs (Medical Research Council Grade 2), but her deep-tendon reflexes were intact. Babinski\u2019s sign and ankle clonus were absent.\nUpon initial laboratory analysis, her sodium was 142.8 mEq/L; potassium, 2.3 mEq/L; chloride, 125.5 mEq/L; calcium, 7.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; magnesium, 2.6 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 17.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and albumin, 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, suggesting renal loss. Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO2 of 67.8 mmHg, HCO3 of 7.6 mEq/L, SpO2 of 90.2%, and a serum anion gap of 9.7, suggesting normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1.\nDue to the patient\u2019s hypotension and altered mental status, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. She required mechanical ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen due to lethargy, somnolence, and respiratory failure (PCO2 45.3 mmHg). She was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and an oral potassium chloride tablet via nasogastric tube.\nIn addition to ventilatory support, she also required treatment for her severe acidemia with sodium bicarbonate. Her desired bicarbonate level was 24 mEq, and her bicarbonate deficit was calculated to be 365 mEq from the following formula: bicarbonate deficit = (0.5 \u00d7 lean body weight) \u00d7 (24- serum bicarbonate) []. Her lean body weight was calculated to be 44.5 kg from the following formula: lean body weight [kg] = 9270 \u00d7 body weight [kg]/6680 + (216 x BMI [kg/m2]). We treated her with an overdose of 480 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose and water solution because her mental status and severe metabolic acidosis did not improve. The next day, her potassium was corrected to normal levels (4.2 mEq/L). However, we found acute hypernatremia with her sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. We began treating her with half-normal saline and 5% dextrose in water, and her serum sodium level gradually decreased from 172.8 mEq/L to 148.0 mEq/L over the course of six days (Figure ). As her hypernatremia was corrected, she became more alert and her weakness was greatly improved.\nSix days after the development of hypernatremia, several other symptoms became evident including dysarthria, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis. Because of these symptoms, we suspected ODS associated with acute hypernatremia. Consistent with our clinical suspicion, a brain MRI revealed symmetric, high-intensity signal in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting CPM (Figure ). Soon after this diagnostic confirmation of CPM, two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions for two days were started with a total of 4394 mL plasma exchanged with albumin 5%, crystalloids, and fresh frozen plasma. The day following the plasma exchange, she regained speech and became oriented. Her neurological symptoms, which included dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis, were markedly improved, but mild diplopia was present.\nAfter the patient was stabilized, we were able to work her up to explore the primary cause of her presenting symptoms. We suspected distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to the normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, a serum bicarbonate level < 10, hypokalemia, and urine pH of 6.5 (> 5.5), and due to the presence of a calyceal stone in her left kidney. We performed a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) loading test to confirm distal RTA []. In NaHCO3 loading test, 8.4% NaHCO3 solution was infused intravenously at a rate of 57 mEq/hour (1 mEq/kg/hour). Urine and blood samples were taken at 1-hour intervals and urine and blood PCO2 were measured using a blood gas analyzer. When the urine pH was raised to 7.6, urine PCO2, blood PCO2, urine HCO3, blood HCO3, urine creatinine and serum creatinine were 44.5 mmHg, 34.8 mmHg, 40.1 mEq/L, 25.8 mEq/L, 64.5 mg/dL, and 0.7 mg/dL, respectively. The results of NaHCO3 loading test revealed a fractionated excretion of HCO3 of 1.68% and the urine-to-blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B PCO2) of 9.7, suggesting distal RTA. In addition to the distal RTA, we also found that she had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome after the results of Schirmer\u2019s test and after she screened positive for anti-Lo and anti-Ra, which was confirmed by a salivary scan and lower lip biopsy. She was discharged and treated at an outpatient clinic with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 4-year-old, male patient, 18.4 kg in weight, physical status I according to the classification system of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) was admitted to our institution for right retinal detachment surgery. On admission, there was no significant past or family history of medical diseases and no evidence of pulmonary or cardiac disease on physical examination. Preoperative vital signs were as such blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, heart rate 92 and O2 saturation (SpO2) 100% on room air. The patient was premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg. In the operating room, standard intraoperative monitoring three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), peripheral nerve stimulator, temperature probe and pulse oximetry were applied. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen. Following insertion of a 22-gauge cannula, he received glycopyrrolate (5.0 \u03bcg/kg), propofol 25 mg, fentanyl 50 mg and cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg intravenously. After induction of anesthesia, paracetamol suppositories 500 mg were given. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-2.5% in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (60%:40%). Intermittent doses of cis-atracurium (0.03 mg/kg) every 20-40 min were injected as needed to keep muscle relaxation based on neuromuscular stimulation. The patient was mechanically ventilated, and it was adjusted to provide an end tidal CO2 concentration of 30\u201335 mmHg, maintain peak airway pressure below 15 cm H2O and an oxygen saturation of \u226598% with 40% oxygen. Ringer's lactate solution was administered according to the standard fluid administration guidelines during anesthesia. Normothermia was maintained during the whole procedure by the use of a forced air warming device. Few minutes later, after start of surgery, the noninvasive blood pressure, which was around 90/55 mmHg, suddenly rose to 220/120 mmHg and the heart rate, previously around 75 beats/min, increased to 140 beats/min (sinus rhythm). Initially, the inspired sevoflurane concentration was increased to increase the depth of anesthesia. On questioning the surgeon, the earlier administration of two drops of 10% ocular phenylephrine to the right eye was confirmed for further dilation of inadequate dilated pupil. A diagnosis of severe hypertension secondary to systemic absorption of ocular phenylephrine was suspected. Subsequently, while preparing the antihypertensive medication, the monitors displayed increased airway pressure and oxygen saturation drop from 99% (with an inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) of 0.4) to 82%. Auscultation revealed crepitations throughout the chest and a blood-stained frothy fluid was aspirated from the trachea. There was neither clinical evidence of airway obstruction nor aspiration on examination and a diagnosis of pulmonary edema was justified at that time. Therefore, fluid administration was stopped, hydralazine (5 mg) and furosemide (10 mg) were administered intravenously, manual ventilation with 100% oxygen was commenced and suctioning via the tracheal tube was performed several times. Seven minutes later, the blood pressure returned to normal and SpO2 increased to 92%, with decreased intratracheal secretions. After approximately 20 min, the SpO2 had improved to 99% (with a FiO2 of 1.0), the blood pressure was 109/63 mmHg and the heart rate was 121 beats/min. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urine output was 280 mL. Surgery was completed, mechanical ventilation was regained with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O and FiO2 gradually reduced back to 0.4 over 30 min with no further desaturation. After surgical closure, auscultation of the chest revealed no crepitations. Then, inhalational anesthetic was discontinued, the fresh gas rate was changed to 6 L/min of oxygen and neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). Tracheal extubation was done when the train-of-four response was 90% and the patient demonstrated facial grimace and spontaneous opening of his eyes with adequate tidal volume and respiratory rate. The patient was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) with oxygen via a face mask. A postoperative 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm and chest radiography revealed no evidence of pulmonary edema. Oxygen 3 L/min was administered through a face mask for 5 h postoperatively and then the patient was discharged from the PACU to the ward conscious and oriented, with a blood pressure of approximately 100/55 mmHg and O2 saturation of 98% on room air and normal chest auscultation.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n56.8", "task": "calc"}

Her initial non-contrast LDCT of chest showed unremarkable finding (Fig. A). Two hours after LDCT, she underwent abdominal MRI after an injection of 15 mL (0.1 mL/kg body weight) of gadobutrol (Gadovist, Bayer Inc., Toronto, Canada). Ninety minutes after the injection of gadobutrol, she was found to have dyspnoea and cyanosis. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 127/77 mmHg, pulse rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 35/min, and oxygen saturation 60% by pulse oximetry.\nAt emergency room, physical examinations showed diffuse wheezes and use of accessory muscles of respiration. The chest radiograph (Fig. A) showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and hilar haze suggestive of acute pulmonary oedema. Laboratory tests showed a serum creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, a D-dimer of 899 ng/mL, and a Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) of 35.4 pg/mL. The repeated chest computed tomography scan showed multiple ground glass attenuation and consolidation in bilateral lungs (Fig. B). An echocardiography revealed no impaired left ventricular function or valvular defect. The initial arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.45, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 28.7 mmHg, and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 48.6 mmHg, which was remarkable for severe oxygenation impairment with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 121.5 (FiO2: 40%). Under a diagnosis of MRI contrast-induced ARDS, she was transferred into intensive care unit (ICU) where BiPAP ventilation with a 15/5 cm H2O pressure support was administered. Her hypoxaemia improved to a PaO2 level of 85 mmHg after the use of BiPAP ventilation. In addition, she received intravenous dexamethasone 5 mg immediately at emergency room and then switched to methylprednisolone injection with a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg daily.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 28-year-old African woman (72kg, 166cm) with anti-Cromer Tc(a) and anti-Jka antibodies was admitted to the obstetric emergency department at our University Hospital at 31+4 weeks\u2019 gestation for heavy vaginal bleeding. She had a history of two prior at-term cesarean deliveries (in 2006 and 2010) and two voluntary abortions. She had a positive indirect Coombs test near the beginning of pregnancy. Low-titer anti-Tc(a) antibodies had been identified and closely monitored.\nA month before admission to our department (at 27+3 weeks\u2019 gestation), she had been hospitalized for cervical shortening (23mm). Ultrasonography at that time had revealed full placenta previa and a high risk for placenta accreta. In accordance with the guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [], the ultrasound report was as follows: \u201c\u2026 in grey-scale, a thinning of the hyperechoic serosa\u2013bladder interface and abnormal placental lacunae were found. Moreover, the placental tissue on the left side of the uterus appeared to reach the serosa.\u201d During the initial hospitalization, two injections of betamethasone (12mg) were administered to prevent fetal respiratory distress, and a consulting hematologist requested further immunohematological testing.\nBecause of the rarity of antibodies of the Cromer blood group system and the high risk of heavy bleeding associated with placenta accreta, it was necessary to establish specific policies for the planned delivery by cesarean section. In preparation, parenteral iron supplementation was administered twice weekly beginning in the 28th week to raise hemoglobin (Hb) values above 12g/dL from an initial Hb of 10.5g/dL. Meanwhile, the Transfusion Medicine Department consultant planned two autologous blood donations because no compatible blood was found in a search of the United States Blood Bank network or the network of European blood banks (World Health Organization International Rare Donor Panel). Unfortunately, the autologous blood could not be collected because of sudden worsening of the patient\u2019s clinical condition.\nAt her readmission to our Obstetrical Emergency Department, serial ultrasound examinations and fetal monitoring with cardiotocography were performed. Because vaginal bleeding stopped within a few hours in response to tocolytic therapy, the attending physicians decided to maintain a conservative strategy. Elective cesarean delivery was scheduled with multidisciplinary team cooperation because of the extreme complexity of the case. The cesarean section was performed 3 days later, after a long and detailed discussion among anesthesiologists, obstetricians, radiologists, hematologists and intensivists. Her preoperative Hb was 10.2g/dL.\nBefore cesarean section, the patient provided written informed consent and was brought to the angiography suite (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). We placed two 14-gauge and one 16-gauge peripheral venous catheters and performed radial artery cannulation to monitor intra-arterial pressure throughout the procedures. After local anesthesia of her groin bilaterally, her femoral arteries were punctured with Seldinger technique and 4-Fr sheaths (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) were placed to allow bilateral cross catheterization of her hypogastric arteries with a C1 \u201cCobra\u201d catheter (Terumo Leuven, Belgium). Using a 0.035 inch 150cm Amplatz guidewire (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA), the 4-Fr sheaths were exchanged with two 45cm 5-Fr Brite Tip\u00ae sheaths (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA), with the distal tips in the anterior branches of both hypogastric arteries. This allowed placement of two Fogarty 80cm 4-Fr balloons over the distal tips of the 5-Fr sheaths, within her uterine arteries. Proper positioning of the Fogarty balloons and the effectiveness of vascular occlusion were confirmed with fluoroscopy (Figure ). Maternal and fetal monitoring were conducted throughout the procedure, without complications.\nShe was transferred from the angiography suite to the obstetric operating room. A single fluoroscopic image was made with a moveable C-arm to confirm that the Fogarty balloons remained in the proper position. While she underwent the angiographic procedure, the operating room was set up with an intraoperative blood salvage system (Cell Saver\u00ae; Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA, USA), a rapid infusion system (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, MA, USA), fluid warmers (Level 1 H-1200; Smiths Medical, Kent, UK) and forced air warming systems (Bair-Hugger\u2122, 3M, St. Paul, MN, USA). Before anesthetic induction, she received premedication with hydrocortisone (200mg) as recommended by the hematologist in case of emergent need to transfuse incompatible blood. She also received antibiotic prophylaxis and intravenous tranexamic acid (750mg) to prevent peripartum hemorrhage []. Anesthesia was induced with 200mg propofol, 200mcg fentanyl and 40mg rocuronium and was maintained with sevoflurane gas. A low transverse skin incision through her previous cesarean scars and a lower uterine segment incision were performed, avoiding the upper margin of the anterior placenta. Immediately after delivery of the fetus and umbilical cord clamping, the uterine artery balloons were inflated. As per the obstetrician\u2019s request, the uterine arteries were embolized with Gelfoam\u00ae sponge (Jinling Pharmaceutical Company, Nanjing, China) to stop bleeding. Because the placenta could not be completely removed as a result of its strong adhesion to the posterior wall of the uterus, and because of the risk of postoperative hemorrhage, the surgeons decided to perform a total hysterectomy, as recommended by Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines []. When adequate hemostatic control was achieved, the balloons were deflated. After the uterine lumen and abdominal cavity were closed and no vaginal bleeding was confirmed, the Fogarty balloons were removed. The 5-Fr sheaths were maintained for 24 hours in case further embolization was necessary. The total intraoperative blood loss was 1000mL and the surgery lasted approximately 150 minutes. During the cesarean section, 150mL of blood was reinfused through the cell salvage technology and limited crystalloid fluid therapy was administered (1L of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution). Her temperature was maintained at approximately 37\u00b0C throughout the procedure and serial blood gas analyses were performed to monitor for metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities. Further details of our hemorrhage management protocol have been reported previously [].\nAfter surgery, she was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring of bleeding and coagulation profiles. Immediately after ICU admission, ventilation was optimized, adequate analgesia was provided and she was awakened and extubated. Because no further bleeding was recorded from the abdominal drain, the angiographic 5-Fr sheaths were removed the day after surgery and she was transferred to the obstetric ward with a Hb of 8.9g/dL.\nFour days after cesarean section, she was discharged from our hospital with a prescription for oral iron therapy for at least 30 days and plans for blood count recheck 15 days after discharge.\n\nWhat is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He had facial dysmorphism characterized by hypertelorism (), low-set ears, and highly-arched palate. Thyroid gland was non-palpable, and pubertal stage was Tanner stage 5. Cataract was not detected in ophthalmologic examination. Laboratory findings were as follows: serum calcium (Ca) was 6.7 mg/dL, phosphorus (P): 9.5 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone (PTH): 20 pg/mL, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD): 27 ng/mL, magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL, Ca/creatinin ratio in spot urine: 0.05. Serum albumin, glucose, electrolytes, renal functions, and complete blood count were normal. Early morning cortisol was 14.7 mcg/dL, thyroid functions were normal, and thyroid antibodies were negative.\nThe patient was diagnosed to have hypoparathyroidism. Oral calcitriol and Ca replacement treatment was commenced. Renal ultrasonography (USG) revealed that the right kidney was 96x57 mm in normal localization, while the left kidney was ectopic and significantly smaller than the right one. Decreased renal function in the ectopic kidney was detected by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Multiple calcifications in bilateral centrum semiovale, corona radiate, and basal ganglions were shown by cranial computed tomography (CT) (), echocardiography was normal, and audiometer revealed bilateral mild sensorineural hearing loss. Intelligence quotient (IQ) score was reported as 57 in Weschler Intelligence Scale For Children test, suggesting mild mental retardation.\nClinical and laboratory findings were supporting the diagnosis of HDR syndrome. Family members were also evaluated in terms of hypocalcemia, hearing loss, and renal dysgenesis. His mother had horse-shoe kidney, but others did not have any of the suspected findings.\nThe karyotype of this patient was 46, XY. Genetic analysis using a next-generation sequencer identified a missense mutation in exon 4 p.R276Q (c.827G>A) of GATA3 gene (). This mutation was confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing. The mutation was not detected in his parents, brother, or sister.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 84-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 58 years of age in 1987. He received human insulin treatment for 20 years, but in 2011, biphasic human insulin 30 was changed to biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30). He had stage 4 chronic kidney disease due to nephrosclerosis, renal anemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and sleep apnea syndrome. He had been taking the following medications: amlodipine 10 mg/day, rosuvastatin 2.5 mg/day, and febuxostat 20 mg/day. He drank alcohol occasionally and had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years when he quit 15 years ago. He did not have any food or drug allergies. His family and social histories were not remarkable. His environmental history revealed no abnormalities. He was a retired company director. From January 2015, he experienced persistent early morning hypoglycemia (< 50 mg/dl) with daytime hyperglycemia. Despite reduction of BIAsp 30 dosage, early morning hypoglycemia concomitant with disturbance of consciousness continued to occur. Therefore, he was admitted to our hospital in February 2015.\nOn examination, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, pulse 64 beats/min, blood pressure 126/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to time and place on admission. Neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, normal limb power and sensation, and absence of cerebellar signs. No changes in sensorium or psychotic features were noted. Other physical examinations revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory findings on admission were as follows: fasting plasma glucose, 82 mg/dl; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 7.0%; and glycoalbumin, 21.4%. More laboratory test results are shown in Table . Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, showed no significant change.\nAlthough BIAsp 30 was discontinued after admission, early morning hypoglycemia with daytime hyperglycemia continued even after eating small frequent meals (a four or six meals per day eating pattern). Fasting blood samples revealed a plasma glucose level of 28 mg/dl, immunoreactive insulin > 2000 \u03bcIU/ml, C-peptide 3.03 ng/ml, and high titers of insulin antibody (IA) (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate was at a high level (86.3%). Scatchard analysis showed an affinity contact (K1) of 0.00256 \u00d7 108 M\u2212 1 and a binding capacity (B1) of 99.7 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M against human insulin for the high-affinity sites, indicating that the patient\u2019s IA bound to insulin with low affinity and high binding capacity. He had no history of medication involving SH residues or supplements containing \u03b1-lipoic acid. Moreover, workup for endocrinological abnormality and autoimmune disease did not reveal any significant findings (Table ). HLA-DRB1*04:06 was undetectable, and imaging studies of the head and abdomen showed no evidence of abnormalities.\nThe patient\u2019s serum creatinine level was 2.17 mg/dl, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 23.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. His arterial pH at 5:00 a.m. was 7.277, bicarbonate was 15.1 mEq/L, and base excess was \u2212 10.7. After he was given a gradually increasing dose up to 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate (split four times per day) for the purpose of correcting metabolic acidosis, his early morning glucose level was improved, concurrently bringing pH up to 7.4 (Fig. ). Early morning hypoglycemia disappeared after he took 3 g/day of sodium bicarbonate and three meals plus snacks at night daily (1400 kcal/day) without any oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. The patient was discharged in late March 2015 and continued on the same treatment.\nAfter 9 months of follow-up with these treatments, the patient\u2019s plasma glucose level at 5:00 a.m. was 96 mg/dl, and his arterial pH was 7.376. His immunoreactive insulin level had significantly decreased to 11.4 \u03bcIU/ml, even though the titer of IA remained high (> 50 U/ml). IA binding rate decreased to 42.1%. According to the Scatchard analysis, his IA shifted to higher affinity (K1 = 0.142 \u00d7 108 M\u2212 1) and lower capacity (B1 = 0.969 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M) than his previous IA. During this follow-up period, he had no symptoms of hypoglycemia, his HbA1c levels were around 6.5%, and his eGFR did not change significantly. His daily plasma glucose levels ranged from 96 to 168 mg/dl.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n90.0", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nIn June 2016, a 34-year-old woman from Hunan Province in South China came to our hospital presenting with apparent weakness of the whole body, muscular atrophy, facial diplegia, hypophonia, dysphagia, and intermittent fasciculations of facial muscles starting in 2007 when she delivered her first child. The patient\u2019s symptoms gradually deteriorated and worsened after her second child was born in 2011. She was diagnosed in local hospitals with gastritis at that stage. In 2012, she developed dysphagia and dysarthria. She had electromyography (EMG) in 2013, and the result showed extensive neurogenic damage, supported by reduced amplitude on musculus facialis, all limb muscles, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Two other hospitals diagnosed her with motor neuron disease (MND). She refused to use Riluzole, the first-line drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), so no specific treatment was taken. She came to our hospital with respiratory distress, accompanied with symptoms of pneumonia such as cough and expectoration. She did not complain of visual or hearing impairment. She was a pharmacist and denied any poisonous substance exposure. Her father and mother had a first-degree consanguineous marriage. No other member in her family presented with any similar disorder.\nOn physical examination, her higher mental function was found to be unaffected. Her height was 157 cm, and weight was 27 kg, with a body mass index of 10.95 kg/m2. She had facial diplegia (Figure ) with incomplete eyelid closure, and Bell sign was positive on the right side. Her muscles of mastication had decreased power and salivation was obvious. Sluggish palatal and gag reflexes, and fasciculation and atrophy of the tongue (Figure ) were observed. Fasciculation of the facial muscles was detected. She had generalized and symmetrical muscular atrophy, involving the face, trunk, and limbs (Figures ). She had an exhausted look with bulbar palsy and severe dyspnea. Muscle strength in the upper and lower limbs was assessed at United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) grade IV. Bilateral Rossolimo sign was positive, and Babinsiki sign was positive on the right side. Tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were feeble. No sensory abnormality was detected. Coordinative movements including finger\u2013nose incoordination, alternating movement, heel knee incoordination, and Romberg sign were normal. Meningeal irritation sign was absent.\nAfter admission, the following tests were normal or negative: serum creatinine kinase, copper, mercury, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-nuclear antibodies, thyroid hormones and antibodies, HIV antibody, tumor markers, and electrocardiogram. Paraneoplastic antibodies including Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, Amphiphysin, TR, ANNA-3, PCA-2, and GAD were negative. Genetic studies for whole exome sequencing were negative, including SOD1, ALS2, SETX, C9orf72, and FUS.\nResults of the following serum tests were abnormal (normal reference range in brackets): creatine 27 \u03bcmol/L (31.8\u201391.0 \u03bcmol/L), prealbumin 83 mg/L (200\u2013400 mg/L), uric acid 74 \u03bcmol/L (90\u2013420 \u03bcmol/L), low density lipoprotein 1.93 mmol/L (2.07\u20133.10 \u03bcmol/L), apolipoprotein B 0.52 g/L (0.6\u20131.1 g/L), cysteine protease inhibitor 0.39 mg/L (0.55\u20131.55 mg/L), \u03b22 microglobulin 0.72 mg/L (1.00\u20133.00 mg/L), serum iron 2.1 \u03bcmol/L (11.0\u201327.0 \u03bcmol/L), and zinc 9.64 \u03bcmol/L (11.1\u201319.4 \u03bcmol/L). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 121 U/ml (129\u2013216 U/ml), vitamin B12 184 pg/ml (200\u2013900 pg/ml), and vitamin B2 189.7 \u03bcg/L (>200 \u03bcg/L).\nHer blood white cell count was 10.8 \u00d7 10E9/L, neutrophil rate 87.4% (40\u201375%). Arterial blood gas analysis showed her oxygen was 72 mmHg and carbon dioxide 57 mmHg, and lactic acid 0.8 mmol/L, while the pH was normal. Sputum smear found gram positive cocci and Candida albicans, but sputum cultures for bacteria and fungus were negative. Abdomen ultrasound revealed hepatic microhemangioma.\nChest CT showed bilateral pneumonia. Mild reduction in low frequencies (125, 250, and 500 Hz) in the left ear was detected by pure tone audiometry. EMG showed denervation in the muscles of the right paravertebral T10 and lower limbs, and chronic reinnervation in the upper and lower limbs. The patient refused EMG of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of cerebellum, with anterior lobe involved more severely (Figure ).\nOur patient was characterized with progressive general muscle weakness and atrophy, involving the limbs, trunk, and muscles of cranial nerves (cranial nerve VII, X, and XI). Clinical signs and symptoms and EMG suggested damage to the pyramidal tract, anterior horn cells, and bulbar nuclei. Her history and laboratory findings excluded intoxication, metabolism disorders, vascular diseases, trauma, tumors, and autoimmune diseases. The consanguineous parents suggested that it might be an inherited disorder, though exome investigations were normal. Her condition was special in the involvement of the facial nerve, which is rare in MND. After analysis, her clinical manifestations indicated MMND. So, the final diagnosis of MMND, with complications of pneumonia, respiratory failure (type 2), and malnutrition, was made. We treated her with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg once daily for 5 days) and other symptomatic treatment (e.g., oxygen inhalation, intravenous levofloxacin, and nutritional support). Her symptoms of cough and expectoration relieved a little, but her other symptoms did not improve. She refused ventilatory support by continuous positive airway pressure. She was discharged after the pneumonia was controlled, but intermittently needed treatment for pneumonia and respiratory failure. Her condition deteriorated and she died of respiratory tract obstruction caused by sputum in March 2017.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 82-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure was admitted to the hospital with a 7-day history of fever, delirium, and dyspnea. She had undergone an aortic valve replacement (Perceval sutureless bioprosthesis) 18 months prior due to aortic stenosis. The immediate post cardiac surgery period was complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, transudative left-sided pleural effusion, and oligoanuric renal failure. She did not present any infectious complications and the median sternotomy incision closed normally. Between 1 and 14 months after aortic surgery, she was admitted to the hospital five times because of severe clinical heart failure of unclear cause and some episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. No fever or other signs of infection were detected at all this time, and did not receive any antibiotic treatment. A transesophageal echocardiogram performed 3 months after surgery showed an aortic prosthesis without alterations. On physical examination, her temperature was 39 \u00b0C, she was confused and tachypneic. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur in the aortic position and basal crackles were identified. She presented grade II uninfected pressure ulcers on heels and sacrococcygeal region. Laboratory tests showed a normal blood cell count, a serum creatinine of 2.14 mg/dL, and an increased C-reactive protein (13 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (628 mg/dL). A chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion and interstitial pulmonary edema. Two sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles were drawn at admission, and empiric ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and levofloxacin adjusted to renal function (250 mg daily, intravenous) were started. After 26 to 80 h of incubation into the BACTEC FX system (Becton, Dickinson and Company), all four blood culture bottles were positive. Gram stain showed coryneform gram-positive bacilli with occasional branching forms. After incubation on CNA agar and chocolate agar, colonies were less than 2 mm in size, glistening and yellow. The colonies penetrated into the agar upon further incubation. On the 5th day of admission, blood cultures were again obtained, and the same organism grew in 1 of the 4 bottles. The isolates were initially identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Bruker Daltonics) as C. cellulans. Thereafter, the identification was confirmed by API Coryne strip (bioM\u00e9rieux; code number 7572767), which was an \u201cexcellent identification\u201d for C. cellulans with a reliability of 99.9%, and by sequencing the 16S rRNA (using the BLAST Sequence Analysis Tool of GenBank database), showing a 100% similarity with C. cellulans and 99.8% with C. funkei. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using a microdilution microtiter panel MICroSTREP plus 6 (MicroScan Walk Away, Beckman Coulter). Following EUCAST breakpoints criteria for Corynebacterium, the isolate was susceptible or presumably susceptible (for antibiotics without EUCAST breakpoints, but with low MIC) to amoxicillin-clavulanate (MIC = 2 mg/L), daptomycin (MIC = 0.5 mg/L), levofloxacin (MIC = 2 mg/L), linezolid (MIC\u22641 mg/L), tetracycline (MIC\u22641 mg/L), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC = 0.006 mg/L) and vancomycin (MIC = 0.5 mg/L), and resistant or presumably resistant to amikacin (MIC = 32 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC> 2 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC> 2 mg/L), clindamycin (MIC> 2 mg/L), erythromycin (MIC = 1 mg/L), gentamycin (MIC = 4 mg/L), imipenem (MIC = 4 mg/L), meropenem (MIC = 8 mg/L) and rifampin (MIC = 1 mg/L). The MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin were also determined by Etest\u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux) using Mueller-Hinton agar plus 5% blood, and similar results were found.\nOn the 7th day, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show alterations. Therapy was switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate (1 g three times daily, intravenous), and new blood cultures obtained 24 h later were negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram performed on the 9th day of stay revealed an echogenic and mobile vegetation of 6 \u00d7 9 mm on the prosthetic aortic valve attached to the commissure between the right coronary cusp and the non-coronary cusp. Prosthetic valve function was otherwise normal. On the 11th day, amoxicillin-clavulanate was switched to vancomycin adjusted to renal function (750 mg daily) plus linezolid (600 mg twice daily, intravenous). Surgical replacement was considered inappropriate in this patient due to comorbidity, advanced age, limited mobility and family rejection. In the following days, she developed severe anemia, acute confusional state and refractory heart failure. End-of-life decision-making was implemented, prioritizing symptom control, and antibiotic therapy was switched back to amoxicillin-clavulanate on day 22nd of admission. On the 28th day, she was discharged to another hospital for palliative care, dying 7 days later because of sepsis and severe heart failure.

On presentation, he was noted to be hemodynamically stable, jaundiced, and epigastric abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, creatinine of 3.51 mg/dL (patient baseline of 1.0 mg/dL), total bilirubin 9.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 953 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 66 units/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 58 units/L, and lipase 1529 units/L (upper limit of normal is 60 units/L).\nA CT abdomen and pelvis was performed without IV contrast due to acute kidney injury (Figure ). This revealed a large heterogeneous and hyperattenuating structure at the level of the head of the pancreas close to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with associated mass effect on the duodenum and obstruction of the common bile duct. Marked dilatation of the intra and extra-hepatic biliary tree was also noted. These findings were not seen on CT abdomen with contrast four months prior.\nBased on this presentation and findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital. Given that the large heterogeneous structure seen on the non-contrast CT was close to the SMA and the head of the pancreas, the differential diagnosis included ruptured SMA aneurysm, SMA pseudoaneurysm, hemorrhagic pancreatic mass, and pancreatic cancer. The modality and urgency of treatment of each of these diagnoses vary greatly. Despite the patient\u2019s acute kidney injury, a CT angiography of the abdomen was performed (Figures , ) as a large SMA aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm would potentially necessitate urgent interventions by either vascular surgery or interventional radiology.\nThe CT angiography of the abdomen revealed fusiform aneurysmal degeneration of the proximal abdominal aorta. There was an overall beaded appearance, irregular narrowing, and mural thickening involving multiple visceral media and large size arteries, including the celiac artery, splenic artery, superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery, and right renal artery. A replaced right hepatic artery arising off the SMA extended into the previously described large heterogeneous mass, which appeared to be a hematoma 9.1 x 6.8 x 8.4 cm in size, centered posterior to the head of the pancreas. There were multiple areas of contained active bleeding and pseudoaneurysm formation within this hematoma marginating from branches of the replaced right hepatic artery (Figures , ). Given these concerning findings, vascular surgery and interventional radiology were urgently consulted, but the degree of involvement of multiple vessels precluded any interventions.

On physical examinations, the patient was revealed to be healthy except for an unstable temperature with intermittent fever, hypotension [103/38 mmHg] and weight loss of 15 kg during the course of illness. Laboratory tests revealed that the patient had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of >140 mm/h and suspected anemia with Hb of 57 g/L. His symptoms were slightly alleviated after a blood transfusion with 2 units of condensed erythrocytes. Cardiac auscultation revealed consecutive murmurs in the second aortic valve area. Echocardiography was prescribed to determine the cause of the murmurs. Congenital heart disease (CHD) of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and IE were diagnosed with evidence of aortic regurgitation and multiple vegetations on the pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery wall.

In the emergency department, vital signs were as follows: Blood pressure of 74/42 mmHg, heart rate of 112 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and temperature of 98.6 F. Remarkable findings on physical examination included jaundice as well as abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation, especially in the right upper quadrant. There was no rash or ulcers. As per family, she did not have recent travels or exposure to sick people. They denied having domestic animals at home or any contact to the patient with pets. She was placed on mechanical ventilation and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Admission diagnosis was systemic inflammatory response syndrome with sepsis and septic shock with multi-organic dysfunction syndrome, presumptively secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, possible biliary tract infection (ascending cholangitis), probable spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and alcoholic hepatitis. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation with crystalloids along with vasopressors was initiated. Blood, urine, respiratory cultures and Legionella urine antigen were obtained. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy, composed by piperacillin/tazobactam (2.25 g every 8 h) and azithromycin (500 mg every 24 h), was initiated.\nLaboratory results on admission were: A complete blood cell count of 21,000/mm3(90% neutrophils), a platelet count of 51,000/mm3, a sodium level of 127 mEq/L, a potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L, a bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L and a creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dl.

Chest radiography of the lateral view (seated position) showed several areas of free-air just below the diaphragm (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed free-air, bilateral pleural effusion, and a dilated esophagus and stomach (Fig. ). Based on these findings, an esophageal rupture with mediastinitis was the definitive conclusion and he was thus diagnosed with Boerhaave syndrome. A subsequent esophagogram further confirmed the diagnosis. Nine hours after the onset of the rupture, an emergency operation was performed as follows. Through a left thoracoabdominal incision, closure of the perforation and drainage of both the mediastinum and thoracic/abdominal cavities were performed in succession.

He had been treated with lenvatinib as first-line, then transitioned to sorafenib and trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE). Home medications included furosemide and spironolactone. He had no previous history of SBP and was not on prophylactic antibiotics. Social history was positive for previous tobacco use 15 years prior. There was no history of chronic liver disease or GI malignancies in the family.\nOn exam, vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's weight was 78 kg and BMI was 27 kg/m2. Physical exam revealed scleral icterus, tense ascites and bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities. No asterixis was noted. Exam of other organ systems was nonrevealing. Laboratory testing showed an elevated white blood cell count of 18.8 x 109/L, low hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, a platelet count of 200 x 109/L, elevated International normalized ratio of 1.9, low sodium of 123 mmol/L, elevated potassium of 5.5 mmol/L, low albumin of 1.6 g/dL, and elevated C- reactive protein level of 70 mg/L.

Model for end-stage liver disease sodium (MELD-Na) score was 29, corresponding to 90-day mortality of 20%. Ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrated features of a cirrhotic liver and a large volume of ascites. The portal vein was occluded and measured 1.63 cm. There was cavernous transformation seen with color flow Doppler in the region of the portal vein (Figure ). The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided, large-volume paracentesis and a total of 5.0 L of clear straw-colored fluid was removed. Peritoneal fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells. Ascitic fluid analysis revealed albumin less than 0.6 g/dL, total protein of 1.6 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 182 U/L, and glucose of 43 mg/dL. Ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) count was 2,983, prompting empiric IV ceftriaxone therapy for SBP. Serum ascitic albumin gradient was >1.1 g/dL, consistent with ascites secondary to portal hypertension in the setting of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis.\nPeritoneal fluid cultures were obtained. The culture was grown on a MacConkey agar plate and then confirmed with an API-20E test (BioMerieux, Inc., France). The test was positive for S. enterica, susceptible to ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Therefore, IV ceftriaxone was continued, with a good clinical response. The patient received IV albumin 25% infusion on day 1 and day 3 post paracentesis. The patient needed repeat paracentesis on day 3 and day 6, with the removal of another 5.0 L and 3.1 L of fluid, respectively.

His axillary temperature was 37\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, pulse rate 84 beats/minute, and blood pressure 110/70 mmHg. Systemic examination revealed no abnormality except a tender soft tissue swelling located in the midhumerus of left side, firm in consistency, irregular in shape, and 7.5 cm \u00d7 5 cm in size with indistinct margins. Skin overlying the swelling was reddened, warm, edematous, and nodular with prominence of superficial veins but had no discharging sinus. Movements of the shoulder joints were normal.

But there was no sensory loss.\nComplete hemogram and blood biochemistry including serum calcium (9.1 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Chest X-ray (CXR) posteroanterior (P.A.) view showed a spiculated nodule in the left midzone with an osteolytic lesion in middle of the left humerus (). Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the osteolytic lesion revealed sheets, clumps, and dense malignant cells having hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli and squamoid differentiation at places on the hemorrhagic background. Few cells showed individual keratinization, suggestive of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (). Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of thorax showed a spiculated nodule in left upper lobe with osteolytic lesion in the midhumerus on the left side (). CT-guided FNAC of the left lung nodule showed clusters of malignant epithelial cells with nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, distinct nucleoli, moderate amount of cytoplasm, and distinct cell boundary, suggestive of nonsmall cell carcinoma and squamous cell variety.

Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed no abnormality. 99mTcRadionuclide bone scan revealed an increased uptake of radiotracer over the midhumerus on left side only, suggestive of metastatic bony lesion to left humerus (). So, the final diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of upper lobe of left lung with osteolytic metastasis to left humerus, that is, stage IV disease of bronchogenic carcinoma. Palliation of the symptoms was the only option. With consultation of the radiotherapy department of our institution, palliative radiotherapy (total dose: 30 Gy in 10 fractions) was given to the osteolytic lesion of the left midhumerus with an aim to relieve the pain and reduce the size of the lesion. First cycle of chemotherapy comprising of cisplatin + etoposide was given intravenously following radiotherapy. Although chemoradiotherapy was a very good option for palliation of the malignant bone pain, in our patient, size of the primary lung tumour was gradually increasing (as evidenced by serial CXRs) and pain of the osteolytic lesion of left humerus was not relieved, though the size of the lesion reduced marginally. As a whole, therapeutic benefits on primary and metastatic tumours were very poor, probably due to squamous cell histology which is a chemo- and radiotherapy resistant variant of lung cancer. On the other hand, the part of the limb distal to the metastatic lesion was totally nonfunctioning. This is why below shoulder amputation of the left upper limb was planned. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of left upper extremity showed destructive and expansile osteolytic lesion in the junction of upper and midthird of the shaft of the left humerus, marrow edema, and surrounding soft tissue infiltration (). After first cycle of chemotherapy amputation of upper limb was done in the department of orthopaedics, and histopathological examination of resected specimen showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the bone ().

Almost 20 years before her current presentation, the patient had a history of ascending cholangitis post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, complicated by an iatrogenic esophageal perforation requiring surgical repair and cholecystectomy. In 2015, the patient had another abdominal perforation secondary to an ischemic bowel due to arterial emboli.\nThe patient presented with a one-week history of abdominal pain, dysuria, and fever. Her vitals showed a blood pressure of 86/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 127 beats per minute, which recovered after 500 mL of normal saline. Her urine dipstick revealed 100 leukoestrase and positive nitrites. Basic blood investigations were normal, and cultures were sent. She was started on Ceftriaxone 1 g once a day to treat her urinary tract infection. The cultures came back negative apart from blood cultures which grew V. cholera within a day of incubation (Table shows the antibiotics' sensitivity).\nThe patient was clinically improving but to identify the bacteremia source, a stool culture was sent, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) was arranged. The stool culture was negative, and the CT showed a common bile duct dilatation with a heterogeneous enhancement of the liver, representing cholangitis, but no obstruction was observed (Figure ).\nSince the patient was improving and her CT findings were related to her previous surgeries, no intervention was done.\nShe completed a seven-day course of Ceftriaxone, and repeated blood culture did not grow any organism. She was discharged home, but a few days later, she returned with severe sepsis without a clear focus. Cultures were sent, and the results showed Clostridium perfringens bacteremia. She was started on an intravenous metronidazole loading dose of 750 mg, and then she was kept on 375 mg every 6 hours as a maintenance dose. The patient's condition worsened as her level of consciousness and blood pressure dropped, requiring norepinephrine infusion and intubation. Her intensive care unit stay was complicated with ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Physical examination revealed abdominal pain, localized right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, body temperature slightly elevated (37.7\u00b0C), blood pressure 120/90 mmHg and heart rate 110/min. Blood tests showed leukocyte count at 12600/\u03bcL, the differential white account showing 75% neutrophils and hematocrit 35.9%. Abdominal and chest radiographs were normal. The primary diagnosis was acute appendicitis and appendectomy was decided. Entering the peritoneal cavity from a McBurney incision, the surgeon found large amount of blood and the surgery was transformed to exploratory laparotomy through a midline incision. The findings were enormous hepatomegaly and bleeding due to spontaneous rupture of the IV lobe of the liver. Active bleeding was managed with direct suture of identifiable vessels and absorbable gauze mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful, except of a continuous elevated body temperature (up to 38.5\u00b0C). The patient, five days after surgery, was referred to us in order to undergo further examinations for the nature of the liver abnormality. His medical history was unremarkable. He was previously in good health. His family and past history were not contributory. The patient weighted 65 Kg with 1.75 m height. He was in his right senses and well nourished. Yellow skin, icteric sclera, spider naevi and palmar erythema were not founded. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. Chest radiograph revealed no pulmonary pathology. The abdomen was swollen with the liver palpable. Laboratory tests showed liver function tests normal (before the initial surgery however, after the surgery SGOT, SGPT, LDH were altered three times the normal range) hepatitis markers of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV were negative and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 35 ng/ml. The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen that showed hepatomegaly and a large hypodense lesion of the liver with multicystic appearance with septations and solid portions (Figure ). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in T2-weighted and Short Time Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences revealing hyperdense areas with intermixed hypodense septa (Figure ), and a thrombus in the inferior vena cava (Figure ). The differential diagnosis by the CT and MRI findings was giant hemangioma or cystic malignant lesion. Due to the size of the lesion and the previous history of spontaneous bleeding, it was decided that the patient must undergo surgery. In order to prevent pulmonary embolism, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted and fixated just below the renal veins. Two days later the patient underwent surgery. Primarily, thrombectomy and reconstruction of the inferior vena cava with removal of the filter was performed, followed by hepatectomy of I\u2013IV and VIII lobe of the liver. Intraoperative biopsy demonstrated malignancy or sarcoma of the liver. Frozen section on the remaining liver was performed and showed normal liver tissue. The patient after surgery presented with life threatening bleeding and protean coagulation abnormalities, symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation, due to massive blood transfusion. The patient died the second postoperative day due to uncontrolled bleeding caused of the developing of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Pathologic review of the specimen revealed a 1580 gm left and part of right hepatic lobe, with a 30 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 9 cm tumor mass and the histological examination showed malignant sarcomatous tissue with spares giant neoplastic cells (head arrow) and residual hepatocytes (arrow) suggestive of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (Figure ). Sarcomatous tissue with severe atypia of the neoplastic cells and focal presence of giant cells partially with myoblastic characteristics was also present (Figure ).

She had a history of cyclic pelvic pain since the age of 12. Her past medical history was remarkable for a ventricular septal defect as an infant which was subsequently repaired. She also had left renal agenesis which was diagnosed over a decade later. Multiple surgical procedures were performed for correction of severe scoliosis in her lumbar spine with placement of screws and rods. She had no family history of cardiac or genitourinary disease.\nPhysical examination revealed normal build with a height of 162 centimeters (cm). Her weight was 75 kilograms with a body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m2. She had normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, categorized as Tanner stage 5. Pelvic examination was limited since she was virginal.\nOn laboratory analysis of her blood, the complete blood count and biochemistry were within the normal range. Endocrinological laboratory values were also within normal limits and consistent with her age, including thyroid stimulating hormone of 3.0 uU/mL, testosterone of 11 ng/dL, and hemoglobin A1C of 5.3%. A pelvic transvaginal sonogram suggested that the uterus was distended with fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 12 \u00d7 7 cm fluid collection in the uterus and an obstruction likely at the level of the vagina which was concerning for imperforate hymen or a transverse vaginal septum. The MRI also showed marked underdevelopment of the right side of the uterus (). No other M\u00fcllerian anomalies were identified.\nThe patient was diagnosed with multiple M\u00fcllerian anomalies as the cause of her primary amenorrhea. Surgical intervention was suggested to the patient and her family. Exam under anesthesia revealed a 3 cm blind ending vagina and a 7 \u00d7 7 cm pelvic mass. She subsequently underwent diagnostic laparoscopy () and vaginoscopy (). Intraoperatively she was found to have a distended left unicornuate uterus with a right uterine horn with associated fallopian tube on the right side. Bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes were present. Extensive hemosiderin deposits were identified in the pelvic cavity. On local genital examination, a 1 cm thick complete TVS was identified at the junction of the upper one-third and the lower two-thirds of the vagina. This TVS was diagnosed under ultrasound (US) guidance. The septum was grasped with Allis tissue holding forceps and a stab incision was made. The hematocolpos was drained, and her cervix was subsequently visualized. The vaginal septum was then excised circumferentially. The vaginal epithelium was then approximated with polyglactin 910 throughout its circumference using simple end-to-end anastomosis. A sponge vaginal mold coated with estrogen cream was then placed in vagina to prevent stricture formation.\nShe was discharged home on postoperative day one. The vaginal mold was removed on the day of discharge and the patient was advised to apply estrogen cream in the vagina locally. As our patient was not sexually active, she was instructed to manually dilate the vagina everyday with the placement of dilators. She was given 10 mg of norethindrone daily for 4 weeks to prevent her menstrual cycle and allow adequate healing of her surgical site. After withdrawal of norethindrone, she had a normal menstrual period.\nTwo months later at a follow-up visit she presented with pelvic discomfort and dark brown discharge from her vagina. Clinical examination revealed a stricture at the surgical site resulting in stenosis of the vagina. This stricture was then dilated under anesthesia. The margins of the stricture were surgically resected and the vaginal epithelium was approximated. She was discharged home on postoperative day two. She was again extensively counseled regarding the use of manual vaginal dilation methods in order to prevent recurrent stenosis.\nHowever, she was unable to perform manual vaginal dilatation at home due to vaginal spasms and apprehension. She presented again a month later with vaginal stenosis. The stenosed vaginal edges were again excised and reapproximated and a plastic vaginal stent was placed in the vaginal canal to maintain patency. This stent was then removed after two months and she was again educated about the dilatation methods, but she still presented with restenosis three weeks later. The stenosed margins were resected again and the patient was then evaluated every day in the clinic where she demonstrated vaginal dilatation in the presence of a clinician. After 3 months, the patient was able to perform vaginal dilatation successfully without any apprehension and the vaginal patency was maintained without any recurrent stricture formation. She was also instructed to place a vaginal mold nightly for the next six months. Subsequent evaluation at 4 and 6 months from the last surgery demonstrated a patent vaginal canal with adequate vaginal length of 8 cm.

Additional laboratory abnormalities were significant for uric acid 19.8 mg/dL and creatinine 2.94 mg/dL as well as potassium 4 mmol/L, phosphorus 4 mg/dL, calcium 9.2 mg/dL, and albumin 3.2 g/dL. Urinalysis was significant for protein 200 mg/dL, 20/LPF granular casts, and 7/LPF hyaline casts. A renal ultrasound measured the left kidney as 10.2 cm long, with at least two cysts the largest at 3.5 cm, and without hydronephrosis. The right kidney measured as 10.5 cm long, with one cyst at 2 cm, and also without hydronephrosis. The CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis identified splenomegaly with a splenic diameter of 14.6 cm. No renal calculi were appreciated. Also visualized were several borderline subcentimeter retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes.\nPeripheral blood smear was performed and revealed a myeloid predominance with left shift and a small blast population (0.6%) as well as monocytic phenotypic aberrance (see ). Subsequently, a bone marrow biopsy was performed which identified 20\u201325% of CD 34+ blasts and morphologic features consistent with AML with monocytic differentiation (see and ). Flow cytometry showed prominent monocytes which demonstrated loss of expression of HLA-DR and CD14 as well as coexpression of CD56. Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a pathogenic mutation in the NPM1 gene.\nWith presenting hyperuricemia and acute on chronic kidney injury, he received one dose of rasburicase 3 mg IV given concern for early TLS with concomitant initiation of daily allopurinol. He commenced cytoreduction with hydroxyurea 1000 mg twice daily and after 48 hours, his white blood cell count and uric acid down-trended to 48.5 \u00d7 103 cells per mm3 and 5.5 mg/dL respectively. Creatinine also trended down to 1.98 mg/dL.\nDue to the patient\u2019s performance status and age, hematology offered reduced-intensity therapy consisting of azacitidine with or without venetoclax or best supportive care rather than intensive induction chemotherapy.

On examination she was fully conscious and oriented and complained of severe headache. Nuchal rigidity was evident. No focal neurological deficit was found. Temperature was 38\u00b0C and other vital signs were stable. Past medical history was negative and she did not consume any medication.\nCT scan of the head revealed acute subarachnoid hemorrhage prominently occupying the right sylvian fissure. CT angiography was performed (figure ). The cerebral vasculature was found to harbor three saccular aneurysms at: (1) right MCA trifurcation, (2) left ICA bifurcation, and (3) distal basilar artery. The right MCA aneurysm was presumed to be the ruptured aneurysm due to location of subarachnoid clot and irregular shape of the aneurysm.\nA right pterional craniotomy was performed with the patient in the supine position and head rotated 30 degrees to left. After elevation of the craniotomy flap, the sphenoid ridge was drilled flush with the orbital roof to facilitate exposure of the basilar tip aneurysm. After duratomy, gentle frontal lobe retraction allowed CSF drainage from the optic and carotid cisterns. Right optic nerve and right ICA were identified and the Sylvian fissure was opened from medial to lateral, following the bifurcation of right ICA to MCA trifurcation. A saccular aneurysm was found in the MCA trifurcation projecting inferolaterally. After dissection of the neck it was clipped. Next, opening the membrane of Liliequist, let to the distal basilar aneurysm from the corridor between the right optic nerve and right ICA. The aneurysm was located between the right PCA and right SCA with a wide neck, and its dome projected laterally to right. Successful clipping was achieved. The left ICA bifurcation aneurysm was identified after following the right A1, anterior communicating and left A1 arteries with minimal brain retraction, and gaining benefit from favorable neuroanesthesia. The aneurysm projected superiorly and was also clipped (figure ).\nThe patient experienced an uneventful post-operative period and was discharge within 5 days of surgery.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an unruptured aneurysm on the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA). She had been taking an aspirin (100 mg/d) and atorvastatin (40 mg/d) since the occurrence of cerebral infarction, amlodipine (5 mg/d) and telmisartan (40 mg/d) for hypertension, and metformin (1700 mg/d) for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her hypertension was uncontrolled before cerebral infarction, but it became controlled after taking the medication for hypertension. The patient never smoked and had no history of autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions.\nCerebral angiography revealed a small SCA aneurysm with a broad neck, with a maximum diameter of 2.62 mm and a neck diameter of 2.73 mm. In addition, there was narrowing of both anterior cerebral arteries (ACA), which could lead to extensive cerebral infarction. Because the unruptured SCA aneurysm was small and unlikely to rupture, it was determined to be followed with periodic brain imaging. A dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) was used because of severe stenosis of the ACA.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea that started 3 days prior. She complained of anorexia, nausea, dyspnea on exertion, and chest pain. There was no complaint of cough, sputum, rhinorrhea, or chills. On admission, she was hypoxemic (room air pulse oximetry, 91%), and chest radiography revealed features of multifocal consolidation and reticulonodular opacities in both lungs ( and ).

On day 4, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to rule out diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and atypical pneumonia. Bacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral PCR, Cytomegalovirus PCR, Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR, fungal culture, and acid-fast bacilli smear were performed in BAL samples. BAL samples revealed a clear color fluid, and no microorganisms were detected from any of the examinations.

No other chronic or neurological pathologies or previous surgical treatments were reported. He had no allergic history to local anesthetics and no coagulation test abnormalities. His shoulder was painful for more than six months, with a limited range of motion of the arm. The pain was reported to the upper and anterior part of the shoulder, radiating to the biceps. He had 24-h pain exacerbated by the movements of internal and external rotation of the arm, with a very painful spotted area localized in the suprascapular notch zone.\nThe MRI exam had shown minor subscapularis insertional tendinopathy and acromioclavicular joint hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The orthopedic surgeon had excluded surgical indications, and suggested physiotherapy, without benefits. The prescribed pharmacological treatment consisted of ibuprofen and acetaminophen daily, with limited results. He had received three intra-articular corticosteroid infiltrations, completely useless. A diagnostic suprascapular nerve block with 3 mL of lidocaine 2% using ultrasonography had shown the complete remission of pain for six hours.\nWe decided to perform radiofrequency neuromodulation with an endoscopic approach. The patient received local anesthesia with mild sedation (10 mL of mepivacaine 2% injected in the surgical site and continuous iv. infusion of propofol 1.5 mg/kg/h). The procedure was performed using Joimax\u00ae endoscopic cannula, with small skin incision and continuous washing using normal saline to perform endoscopy. The point of entrance of the endoscope was identified 3 cm below the suprascapular notch to have plane access to minimize the risk of pleural damage. The visualization of the suprascapular nerve was good, and it was possible to have a clear vision of the nerve path through bone structures. The positioning of the stimulation probe was also clear. The stimulation probe was represented by an electro catheter (VoJager, Alfamed) for suprascapular nerve pulsed stimulation, 40 cm long, with a 1 cm tip stimulating terminal. The catheter is flexible with a rigid metallic guide that was removed before stimulation. The stimulation setting was pulsed radiofrequency (Baylis Medical Co.) as 20-millisecond stimulation, 480-millisecond pause, eight minutes total, 42\u00b0C temperature, and 45 Volt impulse power. Even if the nerve was under our eyes, we used electro-stimulation to be sure. We looked after a radiating pain sensation in the anterior part of the shoulder. The test was considered good when radiating pain was generated at 0.3 mA (-).\nThe monitoring of pain was made using the Visual Analog scale (VAS = 1 - 10) during resting, movement, and sleep, before and six times after the procedure (two weeks, one month, three months, six months, 12 months, and 18 months), as shown in . At the same time, the Shoulder Pain and Disability index (SPADI) was determined. The SPADI is a 13-item questionnaire to assess pain (five items = 0 - 50 points) and disability (eight items = 0 - 80 points) related to shoulder problems ().\nThe procedure lasted 45 min.

Ten days prior, he visited a local clinic with left upper back and shoulder pain. He was diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and received a TPI with lidocaine using a 21-gauge, 2.0-inch needle in the left upper trapezius. Three days after the injection, he complained of substernal chest pain of a squeezing nature and chills, and visited the ED of another hospital. Coronary angiography at that hospital was normal. His symptoms progressively worsened despite administration of analgesics, and he was transferred to our hospital.\nHe was an active smoker, with a cumulative exposure of 35 pack-years, and a heavy drinker, consuming 1 bottle of alcohol daily. He did not have clinical evidence of a recent head and neck infection or trauma. He was 163 cm tall and weighed 60.3 kg (body mass index, 22.7 kg/m2). In the ED, his blood pressure was 120/78 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 97%, and axillary temperature was 38.2\u00b0C. A physical examination revealed tenderness and redness from the left side of the upper sternum to the same side of the shoulder. The other examination results were normal.\nLaboratory data were significant for a white blood cell count of 19.9\u00d7109/L, with 86.7% neutrophils. Both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated, at 26.5 mg/L (reference, <0.5 mg/dL) and 80 mm/hr (0\u201310 mm/hr), respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.48, PCO2 28 mmHg, PO2 115.3 mmHg, and HCO3 20.9 mmol/L. Serum glucose was 249 mg/dL and a urine test strip was 4+ for glucose. Other laboratory test results were normal, including plasma levels of electrolytes, troponin, and creatinine kinase-MB. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were drawn before empirical antibiotic treatment.\nChest radiography showed upper mediastinal widening, protrusion of the aortic arch, and consolidation in the left upper lobe (). Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 3.8\u00d73-cm outpouching low-density lesion with an infiltrative margin arising from the aortic arch, diffuse mild wall-thickening in the aorta, and an incidental 6.8-cm heterogeneous enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe (). Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver suggested hepatocellular carcinoma in the S7 segment.\nHe was treated immediately with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and the initial blood culture revealed Staphylococcus aureus. Based on clinical and radiological features, he was diagnosed with DNM after TPI.\nFever persisted following the ED visit, and both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate remained elevated, at 23.6 mg/L and 37 mm/hr, respectively. Antibiotics were changed on hospital day 3 to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, intermittent fever persisted until hospital day 5, and finally subsided when the antibiotics were changed to meropenem and vancomycin.\nOn hospital day 9, he had hemoptysis. Follow-up CT showed increased mediastinal infiltration and a low-density lesion with an air bubble and a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer at the aortic arch (). Based on the CT, we explained the process of surgical drainage. However, he and his family refused aggressive management such as surgery, because of the risk of sudden death during the operation, poor prognosis of underlying hepatocellular carcinoma, and his age. Despite antibiotic therapy, his general condition worsened, and he authorized a do-not-resuscitate order.

Chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening []. The CECT chest showed dissection of DTA just distal to the left subclavian artery, extending over a length of 4 cm with a para-aortic hematoma []. He was planned for surgical resection of dissection and end-to-end anastomosis of DTA through left posterolateral thoracotomy using left heart bypass. In the operation theater, general anesthesia was induced with balanced anesthesia technique. A 37 F left-sided double-lumen tube was inserted for the isolation of the left lung. TEE examination confirmed the dissection in DTA. Midesophageal descending thoracic aorta long axis view showed a large lacerated flap in the DTA opening into a large (4 cm \u00d7 5 cm) pseudoaneurysm cavity. Color flow Doppler showed free flow of blood from the lumen of DTA to the aneurysm. Careful look demonstrated another tear in the wall of DTA few centimeters below the large dissection flap []. Color flow Doppler showed turbulent jet originating from DTA lumen and entering into the same aneurysm cavity. The finding was discussed with the surgeon, and the surgical approach for left heart bypass was modified. Left heart bypass was instituted with cannulation of the left atrium and femoral artery instead of direct cannulation of DTA. A cross-clamp on DTA was applied such that it remains well below the lower margin of the 2nd intimal tear and enough margin of healthy DTA remains available for the anastomosis. Diseased part of DTA was resected, and a Dacron graft was used as a conduit for the anastomosis between proximal and distal end of DTA. After surgery, the patient was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit and extubated after 2 h.

On physical examination, her height was 160 cm and body weight was 70 kg. Her blood pressure was 230/145 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 100 beats per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed a coarse breathing sound with crackling and regular heart beats with no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpable, and her bowel sounds were normal.\nA blood examination revealed a 7,200/mm3 leukocyte count, 16.5 g/dL hemoglobin, a 274,000/mm3 platelet count, 296 mg/dL random glucose, 8.3% hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 28 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 1.5 mg/dL creatinine, 7.0 g/dL protein, 3.6 g/dL albumin, 33 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 24 IU/L alanine aminotransferase, 292 IU/L alkaline phosphatase, 2.58 mg/L high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 248 mg/dL total cholesterol, 111 mg/dL triglycerides, 41 mg/dL high density lipoprotein, 181 mg/dL low density lipoprotein, 136 mmol/L sodium, and 4.2 mmol/L potassium.

A thyroid function test (TFT) revealed 88 ng/dL T3 (normal range, 78 to 182), 1.44 ng/dL free T4 (normal range, 0.8 to 1.78), and 9.86 mIU/L thyroid stimulating hormone (normal range, 0.17 to 4.05). The TFT results showed subclinical hypothyroidism, but thyroid autoantibodies were negative.\nCardiomegaly was detected on a chest radiograph, and the cardiothoracic ratio was 66% (). The electrocardiogram showed inverted T waves in the lateral and inferior leads, with no significant ST changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed LV hypertrophy and severe systolic dysfunction (). The interventricular septal diameter was 1.3 cm, the LV posterior wall diameter was 1.8 cm, the LV internal diameter in diastole was 5.8 cm (normal range, 3.9 to 5.3), the LV internal diameter in systole was 5.1 cm (normal range, 2.1 to 4.0), and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25% (). Coronary angiography was performed, and the results were normal.\nThe patient was treated with multiple antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers to control a hypertensive crisis, but her blood pressure remained >160/100 mm Hg. Abdominal computed tomography was performed to evaluate secondary hypertension, which revealed no abnormalities in either the renal arteries or adrenal glands.\nTo manage diabetes mellitus, she was referred to Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Because the patient had uncontrolled hypertension, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and bone overgrowth, a diagnosis of acromegaly was suspected. Rough and thick skin was observed, and skin tags were noted around the neck. An enlarged jaw and protruded frontal bones were observed, and soft tissue overgrowth of the heel was noted on a lateral view of a foot X-ray (). The basal IGF-1 level was measured as 183.8 ng/mL, which was within the normal range (90 to 360). Acromegaly was diagnosed after performing a 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test (). In a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, GH levels were found to be increased (). MRI of the sella revealed a 5-mm microadenoma on the left side of the pituitary gland (). A combined pituitary stimulation test performed before surgery revealed that both basal and stimulated hormone levels were normal.\nHyperglycemia was treated with 500 mg metformin twice a day and 12 U insulin glargine once a day via subcutaneous injection. We performed a diabetic complication test, and fundoscopy showed severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ().\nThree weeks after admission, combination antihypertensive therapy caused a reduction in blood pressure to <140/80 mm Hg. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant difference in LV hypertrophy, but LVEF was improved to 66% ().\nAfter transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor, the tumor was identified as a GH-secreting adenoma () that showed strong staining with anti-GH antibodies in immunohistochemical analysis ().\nWe performed a follow-up 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test 2 weeks after surgery, and GH levels were suppressed to 0.15 ng/mL, which means cure state (). The levels of GH and IGF-1 were 0.57, 243.7 ng/mL on postoperative day (POD) 3, 0.38, 295.4 ng/mL on POD 50, and 0.4, 249.5 ng/mL 6 months after surgery (). A follow-up transthoracic echocardiography 6 months after surgery revealed improved LV hypertrophy and LVEF compared with preoperative values.\nThe patient was prescribed calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers. Her blood pressure was maintained at 120/70 mm Hg 1 year after surgery. Her blood glucose levels were well controlled, with an HbA1c of 5.4%, using only 500 mg/day metformin without insulin.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 69-year-old man with a past medical history of untreated hypertension, chronic back pain, and heavy smoking was brought in by ambulance to a community emergency department (ED) for severe bilateral leg pain and paraplegia. He had been unable to ambulate and remained lying on the floor for the prior three days. The patient also admitted to chronic low back pain that had worsened over the preceding week and not improved with his usual pain medications of naproxen and aspirin. He had no other complaints and denied any fevers or chills.\nThe patient\u2019s initial vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.6 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 157/84 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 38 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 94% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appeared cachectic and chronically ill. His cardiac exam revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmur. He had no palpable femoral, popliteal, or dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. A Doppler ultrasound performed at bedside further demonstrated a lack of pulses bilaterally from the femoral to the dorsalis pedis arteries. Abdominal examination showed a scaphoid, soft, non-tender abdomen without a pulsatile mass. There was no midline spinal tenderness or step-offs on musculoskeletal examination. Neurological evaluation demonstrated complete sensory loss from T10 and ending on the S1dermatome bilaterally. He had 5/5 motor strength in both upper extremities and 0/5 strength in hip flexion and extension as well as ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion bilaterally. The dermatological examination of the lower extremities revealed pale, cold, and mottled-appearing skin from the hips to the ankles bilaterally.\nInitial laboratory data for the patient revealed white blood cells (WBC) 26.9 x109/L with neutrophil count 88.8%, hemoglobin 14.3 g/L, hematocrit 44.4%, and platelets 288 x 109/L complete metabolic panel showed the following: sodium (Na) 127 mmol/L, potassium (K) 7.3 mmol/L, chloride (Cl) 99 mmol/L, carbon dioxide (CO2) 18 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 82 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) 4.4 mg/dL, glucose 123 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 288 units/L, aspartate transaminase 1,372 units/L, albumin 3.4g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 86 units/L, direct bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, and total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL. Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and partial thromboplastin time were 11.0, 1.0, and 26.9 seconds, respectively. Lactic acid was 3.36 mmol/L and creatinine kinase was 111,693 units/L. Troponin was also elevated at 3.850 ng/mL, and the electrocardiogram showed diffuse and deep T-wave inversions in the inferior, anterior, and lateral leads.\nPoint-of-care ultrasound of the abdominal aorta revealed a linear hyperechoic shadow in the aorta. Chest radiograph displayed a mildly tortuous ectatic aorta and evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CT of the chest demonstrates a Stanford Type B aortic dissection (). The dissection starts from the subclavian and extends well into the infrarenal region of the abdominal aorta with significant mural thrombosis. On three-dimensional reconstructed images of the CTA abdominal aorta and bilateral lower extremities with runoff, significant stenosis is visible in both renal arteries, especially in the left (). The right lower extremity demonstrates near-complete occlusion of the right common iliac artery and both internal and external iliac arteries. The popliteal artery and arteries below the right knee are occluded. No blood flow to the right lower extremity is noted. The left lower extremity also demonstrates severe narrowing with moderate thrombosis in the iliac arteries with complete occlusion of the left external iliac artery. The left popliteal artery is likewise occluded, and no blood flow to the left lower extremity is visible. In addition to the above findings, intramuscular gas is seen in the thighs bilaterally, raising suspicion for myonecrosis ().\nIn the ED, the patient was aggressively resuscitated with an initial two-liter bolus of normal saline. A central venous catheter was inserted in the left internal jugular vein and the patient was started on an intravenous (IV) esmolol drip. He also received IV heparin, calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, insulin, glucose, and morphine during his ED stay. Shortly thereafter, the patient was taken for emergent dialysis in the intensive care unit (ICU) to further correct his electrolyte abnormalities, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis prior to operative treatment. The laboratory abnormalities were partially corrected to a WBC of 17.5 with neutrophil count of 79.7%, K of 6.6, BUN of 87 and Cr at 3.6. The patient subsequently underwent open bilateral iliofemoral aortic popliteal thrombectomy, stent placement in the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries and bilateral femoral endarterectomy and patch angioplasty. While in the operating room, the patient became hypotensive and bradycardic and eventually suffered cardiopulmonary arrest.

The patient was found unconsciousness by an employee, next to an emptied pharmaceutical powder canister that had contained diazepam.\nAttempted suicide was suspected because of a letter left by the patient. Circumstances thus indicated that the patient had ingested 2,000 mg (20 g; 250 mg/kg) of diazepam, some 2\u20134 h prior to presentation at the ICU. The patient has no relevant medical, family, or psychosocial history, as well as no past interventions. No medical report about depressive disorder or previous suicide attempts exists. The patient worked as an economist in the pharmacy. On ICU admission, the patient's blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 90/min, with regular rhythm. The SpO2 was 90%, and the patient was hypothermic (35.5\u00b0C). The patient's weight was 80 kg, height 175 cm, and BMI 26.12 kg/m2. The patient had no renal or liver dysfunction. Plasma analyses revealed no changes in urea (3.27 mmol/L), creatinine (52.9 \u03bcmol/L), bilirubin (6.39 \u03bcmol/L), AST (0.37 ucat/l), ALT (0.21 ucat/l), and AMS (1.38 ucat/l). Further physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood and urine samples were taken for toxicology investigation. According to protocol, the patient was administered 75 g of activated charcoal and 20 g of MgSO4 by nasogastric tube every 6 h. I.v. flumazenil (0.5 mg) administration was without effect. Because of agitation, intermittent i.v. administration of propofol (50 mg) was used. BDZ intoxication was confirmed from blood and urine samples 5 h after admission, with plasma concentration above the upper detection limit of 2,000 \u03bcg/l. Plasma and urine BDZs were measured using DRI\u00ae Benzodiazepine Serum Tox Assay and Emit\u00ae II Plus Benzodiazepine Assay for urine. Because of hypoventilation and irregular breathing, decreased SpO2 (to 88%) and impaired GCS (to 3), the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated starting from 5 h after admission without the need for additional sedation. Subsequent repetitive administration of flumazenil (0.5 mg i.v.; three times) was without effect.\nDuring the subsequent days, the patient remained unconsciousness with an absence of spontaneous breathing. Plasma BDZ remained above the upper detection limit, which prompted the start of MARS on the fourth day of admission and its continuation for 5 days, one session per day. Informed consent was obtained from the patient's relatives.\nThroughout the course of MARS, plasma levels of BDZ were measured twice daily\u2014at 6:00 (before the MARS session) and at around 14:00 (after the MARS session). The first MARS session lowered the plasma level of BDZ from 1,772 to 780 \u03bcg/L, and subsequent sessions further lowered the BDZ levels (, ). By day eight, the plasma level of BDZ had dropped to 191.2 \u03bcg/L. The patient regained consciousness and was weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated. Two days later, the patient was discharged to the department of internal medicine and subsequently to the department of psychiatry.\nAs a result of MARS, plasma BDZ levels were effectively lowered by a similar percentage at each session, averaging 45% (, ). In contrast, changes in the plasma BDZ level following each MARS session showed a different pattern, with a substantial and increasing percentage of nightly rebound following the initial three MARS sessions, followed by an abrupt halting of the increase, and even a net removal of BDZ following the last MARS session (). Of note, when expressed as ug/L change, the nightly rebound following the first three MARS sessions was similar.\nPlasma BDZ levels during the last measurements, when MARS had been stopped, allowed calculation of the elimination half-life (t1/2; assuming a volume of distribution 1.5 L/kg and a body weight of 80 kg). During the first time interval, the BDZ level dropped from 191 to 161 \u03bcg/l in 17 h; consequently the calculated elimination t1/2 was 69 h. During the last 24 h of measurements, the BDZ level dropped from 161 to 111 \u03bcg/l; therefore, calculated t1/2 was 45 h. Overall, calculation of the elimination half-life over the last three time points, when the plasma BDZ level dropped from 191 to 111 \u03bcg/l in 41 hours, rendered a similar result, with a t1/2 of 52 h.\n\nUsing the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n74.279", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of congestive heart failure. He had a history of CKD, for which he had undergone treatment for more than seven years. Furthermore, the patient also had hypertension for 26 years, but his blood pressure was poorly controlled. He had a history of heart failure caused by CKD and was treated with diuretics. The patient had already consulted with his home doctor about the preparation for HD a month before the current admission. He also experienced dyspnea and palpitations for a couple of days. On admission, the patient had a good appetite and was completely alert, with no neurological symptoms. His height was 168.5 cm, and his body weight was 83.9 kg (his average body weight was 80.0 kg). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 140/113 mmHg, body temperature was 36.2\u2070C, and pulse rate was 107 bpm. His respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min with a SpO2 of 99%, and he felt dyspnea while talking. He did not have any peripheral edema, while the heart and respiratory sounds were normal. The results of the laboratory tests were as follows (Table ): white-cell count: 11,200/\u00b5L, hemoglobin level: 11.8 g/dL, platelet count: 200,000/\u00b5L, urea nitrogen level: 83.2 mg/dL, creatinine level: 5.11 mg/dL, and uric acid concentration: 7.0 mg/dL. He had a severe chronic renal failure that might have been caused by nephrosclerosis due to a long history of poorly controlled hypertension. The patient did not undergo renal biopsy because his kidney had already atrophied, but no physical findings or laboratory data indicated any other renal disease. Moreover, laboratory data and the clinical course also revealed that he had anemia from chronic kidney disease and chronic liver dysfunction induced by alcohol.\nChest radiograph showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 57.7%, and costophrenic angles were bilaterally dull. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, which had never been detected before. It also revealed an ejection fraction of 66% with no wall motion disorder or severe valvular disease. The left ventricle and atrium were dilated, as well as the inferior vena cava without respiratory changes. On day one, he was treated with intravenous furosemide and oral tolvaptan for volume overload, as well as oral warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The patient showed a quick response to diuretics, with a decrease in body weight to 80.0 kg and resolution of dyspnea on day three. However, on day 10, he complained of malaise and presyncope while standing. On day 12, laboratory tests revealed an acute drop in hemoglobin, a coagulation disorder, and a worsened renal function (Table ).\nVitamin K was administered for increased international normalized ratio (INR) using warfarin, and red blood cells were transfused. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed active bleeding from a gastric ulcer, which was successfully stopped. Unfortunately, the bleeding led to renal dysfunction, profound urea nitrogen accumulation, and a rapidly deteriorating consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale {GCS} E3V4M6). Therefore, an urgent HD was initiated on day 13.\nA right internal jugular vein triple-lumen catheter was placed for HD without any complications. We planned the slow and gentle dialysis prescription such that there was the least reduction of plasma urea. We used a cellulose triacetate membrane with a relatively small surface area of 1.3 m2. The dialysate flow rate was maintained at 500 mL/min, with a blood flow rate of 120 mL/min. We originally aimed to conduct a short-duration HD; however, the procedure continued for four hours to accommodate red blood cell transfusion. The patient was drowsy (GCS: E3V4M6) even before HD. Three hours after the induction of the procedure, the patient gradually became unresponsive, and he experienced tremors in his mouth and extremities. Approximately four hours after the start of HD, he developed sudden generalized tonic convulsions. We immediately administered diazepam 5 mg intravenously to stop his seizures and stopped the dialysis. The patient subsequently went into a coma (GCS: E1V1M3). Head computed tomography (CT) scans showed a mild edematous change of brain, and laboratory tests revealed a rapid decrease of urea nitrogen (Table ). We also performed a lumbar puncture, but unfortunately, the cerebrospinal fluid could not be obtained as he had a spinal deformity. As we could not detect any other causes for the adverse symptoms, he was diagnosed with DDS and admitted to the intensive care unit. Levetiracetam (500 mg) was administered intravenously every 12 hours, and no seizures were observed again. Furthermore, glycerol (200 mL) was administered every 12 hours to avoid worsening of DDS. On day 14, we tried to perform the HD procedure again, but tremors were again seen in his extremities 20 minutes after starting the procedure. Accordingly, we stopped, after which his tremors resolved almost spontaneously. The patient then underwent continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) on day 15. A smaller polymethyl methacrylate membrane was selected (1.3 m2). The blood flow rate was maintained at 100 mL/min, the dialysate flow rate at 500 mL/h, and the filtration flow rate at 500 mL/h. As shown in Figure , plasma urea concentrations slowly decreased following the procedure. The patient's consciousness gradually improved, and he was fully alert. However, severe aspiration pneumonia occurred, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 9mmHg; FiO2: 0.7) on day 18. He was successfully treated with antibiotics, extubated on day 23, and moved to the general ward on day 25.\n\nUsing the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "output": "### Response:\n64.58", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 63-year-old woman with an impression of a recurrent tumor was admitted with a chief complaint of shortness of breath 10 months after surgery for cardiac leiomyosarcoma. In her past medical history, she had undergone surgery for the removal of leiomyosarcoma in the main pulmonary artery at a different hospital, where she had been admitted with a chief complaint of dyspnea (New York Heart Association Functional Classification II-III). In addition, she did not have hypertension or diabetes mellitus, other than the previous cardiac surgery.\nUpon admission, her blood pressure was 130/90, and her heart rate was 90 beats/min showing a sinus rhythm. Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 160 cm, 60 kg, and 24.4 kg/m2, respectively. The blood test taken upon her admission showed creatine kinase-MB 2.5 and troponin-I <0.02, which were within normal levels. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.48, PO2 61.3 mmHg, PCO2 27.2 mmHg, and O2 saturation 92.3%.\nIn her chest X-ray, no cardiomegaly was observed, but patchy haziness of the right middle lobe was seen. The cardiac computed tomography (CT) showed a massive amount of thromboembolism in the pulmonary trunk, right pulmonary artery, and left anteromedial basal segment artery (). Lung cancer, pulmonary infarction, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease were not observed. Because of a suspicion of recurrent leiomyosarcoma, a surgical resection was decided upon (preoperative echocardiogram was not carried out). There was no evidence of lung metastasis in CT; therefore, lobectomy of the lung was not considered.\nAfter carrying out median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated. Transverse pulmonary arteriotomy was performed in the area straight above the pulmonary valve. Then, a mass with a volume of 4\u00d74\u00d73.5 cm hanging on the pulmonary valve with a stalk was observed. The mobile gelatinous mass was hanging loosely in the right ventricular outflow track (RVOT), infundibulum, and main pulmonary artery. The incision of the right pulmonary artery was made up to the superior vena cava. An incision of the left pulmonary artery was extended to the first bifurcation area. Then, the myxoid mass was resected (). The sufficient back flow from the distal pulmonary artery was verified in both the right and the left pulmonary arteries. The harvested greater saphenous vein graft was used for the reconstruction and widening of the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery. Because the myxoid mass had a well-defined capsule and stalk, we thought that there was no invasion to the nearby apparatus; therefore, we decided upon a pulmonary valve preservation operation.\nThe duration of extracorporeal circulation was 235 minutes, while that of aortic cross clamping was 85 minutes. Extubation was carried out 12 hours after surgery, and the patient was transferred to a general ward on the fifth postoperative day. Cardiac CT performed on the seventh postoperative day confirmed that there was no remnant mass in the pulmonary trunk, RVOT, or in either of the pulmonary arteries (). The patient was discharged on the fourteenth postoperative day without any complications.\nThree months after hospital discharge, she again developed dizziness and palpitation, and an echocardiogram was carried out and showed a generally hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass. The CT images showed a 2.5\u00d72.8 cm mass at the base of the interventricular septum of the RVOT, as well as redundant movements in the direction of the pulmonary artery (). As anticipated, the right ventricular systolic pressure increased to 70 to 75 mmHg. Upon the suspicion of recurrent cardiac leiomyosarcoma, we decided on a radical resection of the tumor.\nTransverse pulmonary arteriotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in the area directly above the pulmonary valve. A gelatinous capsular mass causing RVOT obstruction was removed in the pulmonary valve and subvalvar infundibulum. Then, the transvalvar RVOT reconstruction was performed using a Prima plus 25 mm valve, and the vascular graft after the pulmonary valve was removed. The duration of extracorporeal circulation was 117 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful, and an echocardiogram performed on the sixth postoperative day did not show a mass in the RVOT and revealed a well-functioning pulmonic valve. The images of cardiac CT carried out on the eighth postoperative day showed no residual mass of the pulmonary trunk, RVOT, or in either of the pulmonary arteries (). The patient was discharged from the hospital on the tenth postoperative day.\nDuring the follow-up six months after hospital discharge, a chest CT disclosed findings that leiomyosarcoma metastasized to left upper lobe (lingular segment) and left lower lobe (). Lingular segmentectomy and lower lobectomy were decided upon and performed under thoracotomy. A tumor 3\u00d73\u00d73 cm in size, dwelling apart from the pulmonary artery, was observed in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Another tumor mass with a size of approximately 3.5\u00d73\u00d73 cm was found in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, for which lingular segmentectomy and lower lobectomy were carried out. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days after surgery.

The ophthalmoplegia was remarkable; she demonstrated bilateral abducens nerve palsies and adduction deficit of both eyes. Limitation and nystagmus on vertical gaze were also noted. There was slight dysmetria on both finger\u2013nose and heel\u2013shin testing. Limb dysdiadochokinesia was also observed. Bilateral pyramidal signs were positive. Sensory examination indicated hyperesthesia on the right side. Findings on muscle tone and strength tests were normal.\nShe had an abnormal Hb level of 92 g/L, accompanied by low levels of serum folate and ferritin; vitamin B12 level was normal. Laboratory tests also revealed elevated levels of CA199 and CA242; both were gastrointestinal tumor markers although an abdominal enhanced CT scan reported no findings.

He had a very poor hygiene condition and wore a very inappropriate partial denture. In the past he had complained about pain associated with swallowing difficulties, vomiting and weight loss. In his medical history, X-ray examination after barium ingestion by the patient, showed that the contrast passed through different parts of the esophageal. Barium passing through esophageal took place very slowly and with delay (). Sever constriction in the distal esophagus in cardia area with achalasia view was evident. During esophageal dilation, parietal irregularities caused by spasms could be seen locally. Chest X-ray showed the size of a normal heart shadow (). Fairly uniform opacity based on the upper half of the right lung and pre Hillary was evident, causing the disappearance of pericardium and mediastinum. Uniform opacity could be seen in other parts of the right lung and left middle lung. There was no obvious space-occupying lesion in the chest wall. The findings were the most suggestive of bronchopneumonia. On further investigation, it was found that he suffered of adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) and alacrima.

Her mother reported exertional fatigue and recurrent respiratory infections. Based on her central cyanosis since birth, the differential diagnosis in this girl includes the following: congenital cyanotic heart diseases as DTGA (D-transposition of great arteries), TOF (tetralogy of fallot), pulmonary atresia, single ventricle, and truncus arteriosus. Also, chest diseases including pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas and hemoglobin disorders like methemoglobinemia should be considered.\nOn clinical examination, she had severe cyanosis with grade \u2162 clubbing in both fingers and toes, and resting oxygen saturation was 74% in room air. Her weight was 13 Kg, and her height was 89 cm. On cardiovascular examination, we found normal heart sounds with a mild systolic heart murmur on the left sternal border. Heart rate was 110 beats/minute. Pulse was palpable and symmetrical in the four limbs.\nPectus excavatum was appreciated on chest examination. The examination of the nervous system was normal.\nThe mental growth development was appropriate for the child's age. We mention some developmental milestones observed in this child: Language Milestones (Can say her name and age and Speak in sentences of 5-6 words), Cognitive Milestones (Can correctly name familiar colors and count), Movement Milestones (Can walk up and down stairs, walk forward and backward easily, help put on, and remove clothing), and emotional and social Milestones (Can imitate parents and friends, Understands the idea of \"mine\" and \"his/hers\").\nThe child had frequent respiratory infections and a hospital admission for pneumonia 1 year ago. Her complete blood count (CBC) showed erythrocytosis with hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL. ECG (electrocardiography) showed normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. CXR (chest X-ray) showed increased vascularity with an abnormal paracardiac shadow in the right lung.\nWe found a secondary ASD 6.5 mm in diameter with a left to right shunt and enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk and the right pulmonary artery. The rest of the echo was normal.\nContrast echo confirmed the abnormal connection between the pulmonary arteries and the left atrium through the visualization of bubbles in the left atrium.\nCardiac catheterization was performed, where the presence of the fistula was confirmed between the right pulmonary artery and the left atrium (Figure ).\nMultislice CT shows that the pulmonary artery branch supplying the middle right lobe drains directly into the left atrium through a large fistula taking the form of a large aneurysm accompanied by an absence of the upper right pulmonary vein (Figure ).\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia through a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established, and following cardioplegic arrest, 32\u02daC blood-body temperature was provided. Following right atriotomy, the atrial septal defect was found measuring 7 mm, and it was expanded and its edges hung. Through the ASD, the fistula's orifice was seen to measure 20-25 mm connecting the right pulmonary artery and the left atrium at the point where the right upper pulmonary vein usually opens into the atrium, and the right upper pulmonary vein was absent; then, the fistula's ostium was closed by means of a biological patch using a continuous suture technique with 5/0 prolene. Afterward, the ASD was closed by a biological patch using a continuous suture technique with 5/0 prolene. Other than the ASD, no other shunts or malformations were found during the surgery.

The patient had a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia which was controlled by medication with verapamil 180 mg daily. A week before the surgery, she had undergone a radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. A follow-up electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal chamber size, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. Laboratory studies were unremarkable.\nThe patient received glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly as premedication 30 minutes before surgery. Monitoring included non-invasive blood pressure determination, ECG (lead II), pulse oximetry, and end-tidal CO2 concentration (ETCO2) measurements. Vital signs included a blood pressure (BP) of 125/80 mmHg, a heart rate (HR) of 82 beats/min with regular sinus rhythm, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. Anesthesia was induced using mask administration of 100% O2. 2% lidocaine 30 mg, propofol 100 mg and rocuronium 40 mg were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated using a 7.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained using 2 L/min O2, 2 L/min nitrous oxide (N2O), and 1.5-2.0 vol% sevoflurane. Ventilation was mechanically performed with a tidal volume of 500 ml and a rate of 10 breaths/min. The right radial artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring and a central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein to be prepared for massive bleeding.\nThe operative technique involved intraperitoneal insufflation of CO2 via a Veress needle inserted through a small infraumbilical incision. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained with a variable-flow insufflator at a pressure of 15 mmHg throughout surgery. ETCO2 was kept within the range of 30-35 mmHg with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, a tidal volume of 450 ml, and an inspiration: expiration ratio of 1 : 1.5. The patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position during the LAR. Vital signs were stable, and the duration of the operation was 190 minutes.\nAfter the LAR, hepatic tumorectomy was performed in the reverse Trendelenburg and left lateral position. Twenty minutes after changing the position, ETCO2 increased to 48 mmHg. Assuming CO2 absorption, ventilation was converted to a rate of 18 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 400 ml. Peak airway pressure did not exceed 25 mmHg. Ten minutes after changing the ventilator settings, ETCO2 decreased to 32 mmHg and the vital signs were stable.\nFifty minutes later, the right hepatic vein was accidentally disrupted during liver dissection. Laparoscopic ligation was impossible because the hepatic vein was not compressed. An emergent laparotomy to control bleeding was immediately performed in the neutral position. A few minutes later, systolic arterial pressure decreased from 110 to 62 mmHg. We accelerated the infusion rate of Hartmann's solution, and 10 mg ephedrine was administered intravenously. However, the vital signs deteriorated. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 6.994, PaCO2 106 mmHg, PaO2 259 mmHg, HCO3- 24.4 mEq/L, SaO2 98.3% (FiO2: 0.5), hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL and hematocrit 29%. The waveform of the capnogram suddenly decreased, and progressive arterial desaturation developed. This was followed by bradycardia (HR = 30-40 beats/min) and the pulsatile activity disappeared from the arterial line. External cardiac massage, epinephrine (two doses of 1 mg) and atropine (one dose of 0.5 mg) were given. At the same time, ventilation with 100% O2 was begun and the patient was moved to the Trendelenburg position because pulmonary gas embolism was strongly suspected. Two minutes after initiation of cardiac massage, a cardiac rhythm reappeared and a pulsatile arterial waveform was displayed dramatically. A TEE was performed, and it showed air bubbles in the right pulmonary artery on a mid-esophageal ascending aortic short axis view (). At that time, we decreased the infusion of intravenous solution in order to avoid the formation of an echocardiographic contrast caused by rapid intravenous infusion. However, a mid-esophageal four chamber view showed no residual presence of air bubbles, a normal right ventricle without septal shift, and non-compression of the left ventricle. Fifteen minutes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.280, PaCO2 34 mmHg, PaO2 499 mmHg, HCO3- 15.4 mEq/L, SaO2 99.2% (FiO2: 1.0), hemoglobin 6.9 g/dl and hematocrit 22%. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells.\nThe operation was completed using an open approach without any additional major problems.

Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II\u2013VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.\nSerum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 \u00d7 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 \u00d7 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.\nA fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 \u2109, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient\u2019s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).\nFollowing completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later. At the time of discharge, her hemoglobin remained stable at 11.2 g/dL, and she was able to tolerate an oral diet. She continues to follow up with her bariatric surgeon in clinic with no recurrence of fever or diarrhea.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n65.302", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 74-year-old female patient came in for a follow-up with an extensive past medical and surgical history. During the visit, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 133/83 mmHg; heart rate, 88 beats/min; temperature, 97.5\u00b0F; respiratory rate, 16/min; and body mass index, 27.16. Her medications were the following: vitamin D, potassium, magnesium, aspirin 81 mg/day (calcium supplement), glucosamine capsule, and prednisone 20 mg as needed.\nPast medical history: The patient has a past medical history of skin cancer, endometrial cancer, and Schneiderian papilloma of the right mastoid.\nPast surgical history: The patient had undergone a bilateral hip replacement, hysterectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, breast lump resection, tubal ligation, resection of Schneiderian papilloma (June 2018), and excision of skin cancer from the right leg (December 2019).\nIn 2014, the patient presented with right-sided hearing loss. In 2017, her right tympanic membrane was perforated, with blood and abnormal tissue protruding from the eustachian tube orifice. Right ear tympanostomy tubes were placed, which helped. The tube eventually fell out, and the tympanic membrane healed. She had a recurrence of middle ear effusion, for which a computed tomography (CT) scan of the right temporal area was performed. The CT images with and without contrast showed complete opacification of the right middle ear cavity and mastoid air cells.\nBecause of the opacification of the middle ear and the mastoid air cells, an audiogram was recommended to test the extent of hearing loss. The results demonstrated mild sloping profound sensorineural hearing loss of the right ear with a conductive component at 2 kHz and mild sloping profound sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear. The pure tone averages were 60 dB in the right ear and 28 dB in the left ear. The word recognition scores were 36% on the right and 92% on the left. The fiber-optic examination revealed blood draining from the right eustachian tube orifice. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed extensive fluid throughout the mastoid air cells and the middle ear with some relative enhancement.\nShe underwent right trans-temporal craniotomy and partial resection of the mass in January 2018. Histopathology was performed on the excised mass, which was reported as an ELST. In May 2018, a follow-up MRI revealed the recurrence of the lesion, and on physical examination, the lesion was protruding through the eardrum associated with otorrhea. In June 2018, a re-resection of the lesion was done, and this time, the eardrum, malleus, incus, and external canal bones were removed. There was a portion along the petrous bone and carotid artery where the tumor could not be removed, and the tumor extended from the middle fossa dura to the sigmoid sinus.\nThe patient then underwent radiation therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions). In November 2019, the patient developed right facial palsy, which was treated with two weeks of prednisone without resolution. A follow-up MRI showed a new 5-mm nodule in the right nasopharynx. There was no radiographic reoccurrence of the tumor in the right temporal bone/fossa, and there was no evidence of facial nerve involvement.\nIn January 2020, the patient underwent a right-sided nasopharyngeal eustachian tube biopsy. The biopsy specimen was sent and processed in the pathology department, and the report showed a low-grade papillary neoplasm consistent with an ELST origin. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up MRI and CT in the next six months. The details about how the biopsy specimen was processed and the histopathological diagnostic features of ELST are discussed in the Methods and Materials sections below.\nMethods and materials\nThe biopsy specimen was processed by fixing in formalin and embedding in paraffin before sectioning and fixing on glass slides. After the slides were processed and ready, they were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In addition to H&E, some selected slides were also stained with periodic acid Schiff.\nAn immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was performed using the EnVision method. The process of immunostaining implies the selective recognition of antigens (proteins) in the tissue sections of cells by utilizing the fundamental rationale of antibody binding particularly to the antigens in the biological tissue. The antibodies that were used for IHC in this case of ELST were cytokeratin 7 (CK-7), pan-keratin, cytokeratin 20 (CK-20), cytokeratin 19 (CK-19), vimentin, glial fibrillary acid protein (GAF), thyroglobulin, and Ki-67. The slides were boiled under high pressure with citrate buffer (0.01 mole/L, pH 6.0) for the purpose of antigen retrieval. The proper positive and negative controls were also performed.\nHistopathology\nLow Power\nMorphologically, at low power, the specimen showed mostly papillary and focally glandular architecture. The neoplastic proliferation of the tumor cells comprised columnar and focally cuboidal cells with round to oval nuclei that show mild to moderate pleomorphism with abundant extracytoplasmic mucin (Figures , ). As mentioned above, the tumor cells were generally columnar or cuboidal and cohesive, often with distinct cell boundaries. Above the basement membrane and underneath the luminal cells was a layer of conspicuous myoepithelial cells. The epithelial cells have a clear-pale cytoplasm, luminal, central, and uniform nuclei. In the case of infected and old healing lesions, inflammatory infiltrates were often present next to neoplastic cells along with granulation tissue.\nHigh Power\nOn higher magnification, a single layer of columnar to cuboidal cells lined the papillary and glandular structures. Moderate to mild pleomorphism, rare mitotic activity, and necrosis were not observed. On the other hand, multiple acinar configurations with infiltrative growth patterns and desmoplastic responses were seen (Figure ). Unconventional microscopic features that were not observed in our case of ELST but may be present in others include intermittent thyroid-like hypercellular regions with cystic glandular spaces filled with colloid substances, areas of hemorrhage, and necrosis with cholesterol clefts, mitotic figures, and structures that appear similar to choroid plexuses papillomas.\nImmunochemistry\nAs described in the Methods and Materials sections, an IHC study was performed. CK-20, which highlights papillary growth, was negative, whereas CK-7 immunostaining was positive as evident in Figures , .\nDiagnostic modalities for an ELST\nRadiography\nIn this case of ELST, both CT and MRI were used as the imaging diagnostic tools. The CT scan and MRI results showed opacifications in the middle ear and the mastoid air cells in 2018, during the initial presentation of the patient. After partial resection of the lesion, the patient developed a nasopharyngeal mass along with middle ear effusion, which was diagnosed through a CT scan and MRI in January 2020.\nThe CT scan and MRI techniques are widely used to diagnose ELST []. The CT scan images usually show a lytic temporal bone mass that typically extends into the posterior cranial cavity, which may present as a cerebellopontine angle tumor. In most cases, the tumor center rests at or near the temporal bone at the posterior medial surface [,].\nAngiography and Audiogram\nApart from the imaging modalities, the most sophisticated procedure to diagnose an ELST in clinical practice is angiography. Compared to an angiography, an audiogram is a noninvasive test that was performed in this case of ELST. The audiogram showed that the patient had significant hearing loss in the right ear and moderate hearing loss in the left ear because of an invading ELST. A fiber-optic examination was also performed, which showed blood draining into the eustachian tube.\nAngiography was not performed on this patient. However, according to previous angiography results in the literature, the tumor can have a dual blood supply from intra- and extra-cranial sources, making it extremely vascularized. A jugulotympanic paraganglioma is another entity that can mimic ELST because both of these tumors are highly vascularized and can carry potential bleeding risks [].\nDifferential Diagnosis of ELST\nIntrinsic temporal bone neoplasms are included in the differential diagnosis for ELSTs, with paragangliomas being the most common. Meanwhile, metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and choroid plexus papilloma are histologically similar to ELSTs. The ELSTs are papillary cystic structures lined with a simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium and are heavily vascularized. Clear cells, as well as siderophages and cholesterol clefts, are visible (vacuolated cells). Nuclear pleomorphism is minimal, and mitoses are uncommon [,].\nStaging\nThere are no universally accepted staging recommendations. Bambakidis et al. suggested the system described in Table [].\nSchipper et al. defined type A tumors as those with no temporal bone destruction or dura invasion, type B as those with signs of osseous labyrinth infiltration and sensorineural hearing loss, and type C as those that have invaded the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb [,].\nThe patient in this case underwent resection for a tumor that extended into the sigmoidal sinus and middle cranial fossa. If we follow the proposed staging system, then it is obvious that the tumor was an aggressive one, and the patient presented as stage III at the time of treatment.\nTreatment\nComplete resection with negative margins is the treatment of choice for ELST, but in advanced cases, this may not be possible. As the patient presented as ELST stage III, the only universally accepted treatment of choice is complete resection of the neoplastic tissue, which is recommended. Because of the complexity and advanced stage of the disease, the tumor was only partially resected. Under general anesthesia, she underwent a trans-temporal craniotomy and a partial resection of the lesion, along with resection of the eardrum, malleus, incus, and external canal bones. There were portions along the petrous bone, carotid artery, middle cranial fossa, and sigmoid sinus where the tumor could not be removed.\nAfter the surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered with subsequent follow-ups. In January 2020, her follow-up MRI results showed a 5-cm lesion in the nasopharynx that was biopsied and confirmed as a reoccurrence of the ELST. The relapse of the ELST after resection confirms the aggressive nature and high recurrence rate of this condition.\nBecause the tumor relapsed, follow-up CT scans and MRIs were scheduled every six months, and close monitoring was recommended. From the patient's past medical and surgical history, she developed the ELST after the resection of the Schneiderian papilloma. Schneiderian papillomas are mostly benign, non-aggressive neoplasms that arise from the sinonasal mucosa. The development of ELST from a Schneiderian papilloma is quite rare. The pathological variants, classification, differentials diagnoses, etiological factors, clinical features, and treatment modalities of ELST and Schneiderian papillomas are elaborated in detail in the Discussion section.\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n1", "task": "calc"}

She was asymptomatic eight months prior to the day she was hospitalized, when she had asthenia, adynamia, hyporexia, symptoms of dizziness, and vertigo. Six months prior to admission, the symptoms increased, with onset of loss of balance, and postural instability. The patient also developed deterioration for walking, with repeated falls, which led her to stop walking for fear of falling, and limited her physical daily living activities to simply transferring from the chair to the bed. Likewise, it was noted that upon flexing her neck, she reported feeling an electrical discharge irradiating from her back to her legs. Two months before hospital admission, she noted lesions on the tongue, which produced a burning sensation and pain when swallowing foods - leading her to decreased intake of food and a loss of 5 kg coupled with increased feeling of weakness in her general state. She consulted with her local hospital, where she was diagnosed with paraparesis and anemia to continue studies.\nAs personal antecedents, she revealed hypertension managed with captopril 50 mg every 12 h. She did not report alcohol consumption, vegetarian nutritional habits, or other personal or family antecedents of importance.\nUpon physical exam for admission, she was in poor general state, pale, and marked loss of muscle mass.

Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cryoglobulin, hepatitis B virus antigen, and anti-hepatitis C antibodies were all negative. Monoclonal proteins were not detected in the serum or urine. Circulating IgA-class anti-PLA2R antibodies were not determined by our in-house ELISA [] using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA as a secondary antibody.\nDue to the presence of NS, a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed global scleroses in 2 of 20 glomeruli. The functioning glomeruli showed no mesangial proliferation and no bubbling/spike appearance along the glomerular capillary walls (). In the tubulointerstitium, mild lymphocyte infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were observed. There was moderate arteriolar hyalinosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed 2+ granular staining for IgA- and IgA1-heavy chains (b, c), 2+ granular staining for \u03ba- and \u03bb-light chains (f, g), and trace granular staining for C3 (h) along the glomerular capillary walls, but no significant staining for IgG-, IgA2-, IgM-heavy chains, or C1q (a, d, e, i). An immunofluorescence study using anti-PLA2R antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) showed negative glomerular staining.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe patient was an 18-year-old man who had been complaining of exertional cough and dyspnea for 4 months. He had no medical and familial history. He graduated from junior high school but did not go to high school or work. He presented to our hospital after visiting a general practitioner for epigastric discomfort and nausea. At that time, urinalysis revealed massive proteinuria. On the next day, he was referred and admitted to our hospital for a thorough examination. He had no history of hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, drug abuse, ureteral reflux, premature birth, or any other diseases.\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.7\u00b0C, a body weight of 62 kg, and a height of 168 cm. Blood pressure was 157/85 mm Hg. There were evident leg edema, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, and no skin lesions. The laboratory findings revealed decreased serum total protein (5.9 g/dL) and albumin (2.6 g/dL); normal serum creatinine (SCr, 0.9 mg/dL) and eGFR (95 mL/min/1.73 m2); elevated LDL cholesterol (224 mg/dL); and slightly elevated serum calcium (10.6 mg/dL). BNP level was remarkably elevated (1,850 pg/mL). Urinalysis revealed a subnephrotic level of urinary protein (3.0 g/day), microhematuria (5\u20139/HPF), no leukocyturia, and no bacteria. The soluble interleukin 2 receptor level was elevated (2,905 U/mL); serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal (14.2 U/L); renin activity was remarkably elevated (39 ng/mL/h); plasma aldosterone level was within normal limits (184 pg/mL). The urinary N-acetyl-glucosaminidase level was remarkably elevated (85.6 IU/L). Hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and HIV antigen and antibody were all negative. Immunoglobulins, complements, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all negative. Tuberculin test was negative.\nThe chest X-ray showed enhanced pulmonary congestion and no detectable hilar lymphadenopathy. In contrast, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed hilar lymphadenopathy without fibrosis in any lung field. Furthermore, abdominal CT revealed bilateral normal-sized kidneys and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed uptakes in the pulmonary hilum, mediastinum, bilateral submaxillary glands, bilateral parotid glands, and bilateral inguinal regions. Echocardiography detected severe cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction 25%), diffuse akinesis of the ventricular wall, and atrial septal defect, but it did not detect thinning of the interventricular septum base. However, electrocardiogram-gated cardiac CT revealed thinning of the interventricular septum base, and this finding was supported by a cine magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac dysfunction and thinning of the ventricular septum base were supportive findings of cardiac sarcoidosis.\nOn the first admission, the patient received treatment for heart failure and hypertension, including temocapril hydrochloride, calcium channel antagonist, carvedilol, spironolactone, and carperitide. Thereafter, the urinary protein level decreased to <1 g/day, and the heart failure and hypertension improved. On the 30th hospital day, the patient was discharged. The inguinal biopsy that was performed as outpatient procedure detected granulomas; therefore, the diagnosis was sarcoidosis. On the 69th day, the SCr level gradually increased to 2.00 mg/dL (eGFR 39.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio increased to 3.2 g/gCr. At this time, the serum albumin and LDL cholesterol levels were 3.7 g/dL and 134 mg/dL, respectively. Therefore, he was readmitted for renal investigation.\nSubsequent renal biopsy revealed the presence of 32 glomeruli, 8 of which showed global sclerosis. Mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, or epithelial change was not observed. In 4 glomeruli, segmental sclerotic lesions were found near the vascular pole and were classified as the perihilar variant of FSGS [] (Fig. ). The diameter of the Bowman's space of the FSGS lesions was maintained at approximately 200\u2013230 \u03bcm. Conversely, several ischemic glomerular changes were found, including atrophic Bowman's capsule, glomerular tuft shrinking, and global sclerosis (Fig. ). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration accounted for 70% of the renal parenchyma. Mononuclear cell infiltration, giant cells, and noncaseous granulomas in the tubulointerstitium were noted. The majority of the granulomas involved small arteries and/or arterioles, many of which had intimal wall thickness, reduplicated internal elastic lamina, and narrow lumen (Fig. ). Many of the epithelioid cells of these granulomas were arranged concentrically around the artery/arteriole and formed a multilayer structure.\nImmunostaining by an enzyme-labeled antibody method revealed focal and segmental deposits of IgM (1+) in the glomerular lesions. In the tubulointerstitium, no significant deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, and C3 were found. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68-positive macrophage accumulation in the tubulointerstitial granulomas but not in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy did not detect any glomeruli. Based on these findings, the pathological diagnosis was tubulointerstitial granulomatous angiocentric vasculitis with FSGS.\nHe received oral prednisolone 30 mg/day after the renal biopsy revealed renal sarcoidosis. At 27 days after the initiation of steroid therapy, the SCr level decreased to 1.60 mg/dL (eGFR 50.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), with a simultaneous decrease in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio to <0.5 g/gCr. Thereafter, oral prednisolone was tapered to 25 mg/day, and the patient was discharged on the 38th day of the second hospital stay (the 108th day).\nAfter discharge, his blood pressure stabilized. Later in the clinical course, nifedipine could be reduced, and temocapril was discontinued. Echocardiography showed recovery of cardiac function (ejection fraction 55.4%). Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered to 2 mg/day after 8 years of steroid initiation, and the SCr level decreased to 1.22 mg/dL (eGFR 60.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) after 8.8 years of the initial presentation. The urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was maintained at <0.3 g/gCr. No other immunosuppressants were used. No relapse in the clinical course has occurred at the time of writing this manuscript.\n\nWhat is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

He had a fever one week prior admission that relieved with sacetaminophen, and no other complaints were reported. He had no contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. He has history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. He previously consumed aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, diltiazem, atorvastatin and subcutaneous insulin.\nHis blood pressure (BP) was 132/75 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 79 beats per minutes (bpm) regular, and respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation of 85% (free air) that improved to 95% with a non-rebreathing oxygen mask (NRM) 15 Liters per minute. His physical examination showed no increased jugular venous pressure, bilateral lung crackles, pleural friction rub, and leg edema.\nComprehensive evaluations were performed, including ECG, COVID-19 antigen swab, laboratory examination, and chest radiography. His initial ECG showed normal sinus rhythm of 79 bpm, left axis deviation, with inferior OMI. Laboratory data showed increased CRP (195.3 mg/L), hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), respiratory failure, and respiratory acidosis. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pneumonia. COVID-19 antigen swab was positive. Thus patient and family were consent for isolation and tracing procedure. As his blood gas showed respiratory failure with severe ARDS (\nPaO\n2/\nFiO\n2 82 mmHg), we planned on invasive ventilation, however the procedure was postponed due to unavailability of ventilator machine and intensive care unit overload.\nHe was then started on antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin, antiviral therapy with remdesivir, dexamethasone, continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) multivitamins and his daily medication (insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, beta-blockers, nitrates, and atorvastatin). Tocilizumab 400 mg was also given on the second day of admission and continued for 5 days. His vital signs and laboratory examinations were routinely monitored.\nDuring the sixth day of admission, his oxygen saturation deteriorated. He was then put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with slightly better oxygen saturation (92-94%). His symptoms showed gradual improvement in several days. His laboratory examination on the tenth day showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR), increased D-Dimer. No prolonged hemostatic values were found. Plasma prothrombin time (PPT) was 20 sec, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 38.6 sec.\nOn the ninth day of admission, the patient reported gross hematuria, at that time he was still on unfractionated heparin therapy within targeted APTT. Laboratory data showed significantly reduced thrombocytes (40,000 mg/L). Urine examination showed gross hematuria with leukocyturia (10\u201315 cells/field), nitrituria, and proteinuria (2+). The patient underwent ECG and chest radiography evaluation, which showed no significant changes (\n).\nHeparin was thought to be the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient. Since heparin antibody was not routinely checked in the developing country, we choose HIT\u2019s scoring system as an alternative. The scoring system shows 4Ts of 6 and HEP Scoring system of 5 (\n). Both 4Ts and HEP scoring indicate a high-risk probability for HIT, hence the anticoagulant was switched to rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily. The symptoms were then improved with the absence of hematuria after 2 days. The thrombocyte evaluation showed normalization to 177,000 on the eleventh day.

He was in his usual state of health, until about a week before the hospital presentation when he began to have generalized body fatigue. Symptoms developed into supra-pubic discomfort associated with frequency, urgency, dysuria, and gross hematuria involving the passage of clots. A day before the hospital visit, he was alert, oriented, and able to converse normally, but on the day of admission, he had been delirious and agitated for few hours. A review of systems was negative for weight changes, history of malignancy, urolithiasis, exposure to industrial chemicals, history of gastrointestinal tract disease, radiation therapy, and trauma.\nPast medical histories were significant for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had had coronary artery bypass surgery, a total metatarsal amputation due to chronic recurrent osteomyelitis, and angioplasty with stent placement in the lower extremity. There was no known drug allergy and home medications were atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol succinate, glargine, liraglutide, losartan, tamsulosin, famotidine. He resided in a house, had a 35 pack-year cigarette smoking, drank alcohol occasionally, and denied recreational drug use. Family history was significant for diabetes mellitus II, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack.\nOn examination, the patient\u2019s temperature was 100.6\u00b0C, his heart rate was 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 143/94 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. He appeared obese, confused, and agitated. He was alert to self, but not to time, place, or situation. The patient\u2019s pupils were round and reactive to light. He was anicteric and dry mucosal, with a supple neck. The patient\u2019s lungs exhibited decreased bilateral breath sounds due to body habitus. His heart had a regular rate and rhythms, as well as normal S1 and S2 sounds, with no gallops, rubs, or murmur. The abdomen displayed normative bowel sounds, was soft, and non-distended. There was no guarding, but there was tenderness at the suprapubic and costovertebral regions. Anal-rectal sphincter tone was normal and there was no mass in the rectum. The patient\u2019s prostate was diffusely enlarged with normal palpation and the genitourinary examination showed gross hematuria, with clots. Testes were bilaterally descended with minimal atrophy. The patient\u2019s extremities showed no ankle pitting edema. The results of the remaining examinations conducted were unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings were significant for elevated lactate (2.7 mg/dl) (0.5-1.9), leukocytosis (28,100/uL), hemoglobin (Hgb) (11.1 gm/dl), hematocrit (HCT) (33.7%), and platelets (223 K/uL). The comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable, except for serum creatinine (1.6 mg/dl) (0.7-1.3), glucose (270 mg/dl) (74-106), and HbA1c (7.7%). Urinalysis revealed macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/dl), glucosuria (>1000 mg/dl), and ketonuria, leukocyte esterase, and leukocyturia (25-50 white blood cells per field, and too-numerous-to-count red blood cells per field). Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and ammonia levels were all normal. Electrocardiograph and chest X-ray results were both unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for acute pathology. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed dense material within the bladder, and air within the bladder wall, bilateral hydronephrosis, and hydroureter (Figures -).\nThe patient was fitted with a urinary (Foley) catheter. Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin were started. Throughout the hospital course, specialists in infectious disease and urology were consulted. Concerns for pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, urolithiasis, malignancy, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous etiology were all low after extensive investigation. The patient\u2019s symptoms were caused by urinary outlet obstruction in the setting of enlarged benign prostatic hyperplasia. After two days, the blood culture was negative, but the urine culture grew Escherichia coli (10,000-50,000 CFU/ml), sensitive to ceftriaxone. The antibiotic was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. The patient\u2019s mental and clinical status improved on day 6. He was discharged with outpatient intravenous ceftriaxone (2 gm every 24 hours for 14 days), a urinary (Foley) catheter, and outpatient follow-up.

She consulted a pulmonary medicine office. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was diagnosed from the chest computed tomography (CT) findings. She was followed without treatment. Two months later, she consulted an otolaryngologist and was diagnosed with bilateral otitis media. She was treated with medications and received bilateral myringotomies, but the otitis media remained refractory. Four weeks earlier, nocturnal cough and anorexia had appeared. She consulted a community hospital. Blood tests disclosed a leukocyte count of 11 300/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, and creatinine 0.56 mg/dL. Chest CT scan showed no change of IPF. Garenoxacin at a dose of 200 mg per day was prescribedfor 7 days without improvement. Five days before, low-grade fever appeared. She was referred to our division. Past myringotomies were observed in both tympanic membranes. Late inspiratory fine crackles were heard at the base of the lungs. AAV was strongly suspected from the history, especially intractable otitis media. Laboratory values were as follows: leukocyte count 11 800/\u03bcL; hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL; platelet count 373 000/\u03bcL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 18 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 12 IU/L; creatinine 0.52 mg/dL; CRP 6.2 mg/dL; and erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR) 85 mm/h. Urinalysis disclosed trace hematuria and no proteinuria. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA was positive at 43.5 U/mL. Proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA was negative. She was admitted to the division of rheumatology for examination. On admission, livedo reticularis was observed in both legs. Skin biopsy of the lesion showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis without fibrinoid necrosis in small arteries and veins located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue (Figure ).

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 68-year-old female non-smoker was referred to our emergency department due to progressive dyspnea. On physical examination, she exhibited tachypnea (20 breaths per minute) and her oxygen saturation was 85%, her pulse was regular at 91 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 116/70 mmHg. Chest CT revealed a 36-mm mass with a cavity in the right S9 (Fig. ), and a 10-mm nodule in the right S6. CT also revealed right middle lobe atelectasis due to bulky hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes (Fig. ). Concomitantly, a bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism was identified. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal a left ventricular function; the right ventricle was dilated with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and her systolic pulmonary artery pressure was elevated (estimated pressure: 55 mmHg); these findings were considered to have been caused by bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism. Ulthrasonography of the lower extremity veins revealed right fibular vein thrombus. Her serum D-dimer, BNP and CEA levels were elevated to 8.0 \u03bcg/mL (normal range: <1.0), 332.5 pg/mL (normal range: <18.4) and 14.6 ng/mL (normal range: <5.0), respectively.\nEnhanced CT performed 1 week after the administration of intravenous heparin and oral edoxaban tosilate hydrate, which were administered immediately after the detection of the bilateral pulmonary and right fibular vein embolisms, revealed that the pulmonary artery and right fibular venin thrombus had disappeared. Subsequently, the pathological analysis of a bronchoscopy specimen led to a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Based on these results, she was clinically diagnosed with T3N2M0, stage IIIA adenocarcinoma. As lung cancer associated with pulmonary thromboembolism was taken into consideration, EGFR-TKI treatment was proposed as the first-line systemic therapy and afatinib (40 mg/day) was prescribed after receiving her informed consent. In spite of requiring a dose reduction to 30 mg due to grade 3 diarrhea, she became asymptomatic at 2 months after the initiation of treatment. Chest CT revealed the marked response of both tumors and lymph node metastases with the disappearance of the middle lobe atelectasis (Fig. ). Her serum CEA level decreased to within the normal range (1.4 ng/mL).\nWe planned surgery to remove the residual lesions. Three days after the discontinuation of afatinib and after receiving her informed consent, we performed right middle and lower lobectomy with systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Complete resection was achieved, with a negative bronchial margin. A histological examination showed the prominent proliferation of fibroblasts accompanied by lymphocytes and histiocytes (Fig. ). However, residual viable tumor cells were found in a small area of the primary lesion (Ef.2a, Fig. ) because an immunohistochemical examination revealed a few small clusters of atypical cells that were positive anti-pancytokeratin (AE1/3) and thyroid transcription factor 1. There were no malignant cells in the dissected lymph nodes. Down-staging from clinical stage IIIA to pathological stage IA was established. We did not identify an exon 20 point mutation (T790 M) in any of these specimens.\nAlthough afatinib therapy was continued after the operation, she developed spinal cord compression due to 5th cervical vertebral cortical bone metastasis with the onset of neck pain at 8 months after the operation. Direct surgical decompression with tumor debulking and spinal stabilization was performed, followed by radiotherapy. An exon 20 point mutation (T790 M) was found in the resected specimens. Thus, osimertinib is now being prescribed. She is currently alive at 15 months after surgery (18 months after the initial diagnosis).\n\nWhat is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "output": "### Response:\n10.0", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 64-year-old man, a 30-year-long cigarette smoker (30 pieces per day), was admitted with syncope twice on one day to our hospital emergency department in Oct 17, 2013. The patient has two years of high blood pressure history while without any medicine treatment. He had no diabetes mellitus history. In the past two months, he felt chest discomfort sometimes. In the morning of Oct 14, 2013, he suddenly lost consciousness with incontinence while walking in the park. He felt pericardium discomfort before losing consciousness. After regaining consciousness several minutes later, he felt dyspnoeic and sweaty. In the afternoon, syncope occurred again while he was watching TV. His electrocardiogram showed a slight sinus bradycardia of 47 bpm. 24-hour Holter indicated the average heart rate was 66 bpm, the slowest heart rate 47 bpm, the fastest heart rate 129 bpm, and the longest R-R interval 1.6 second. Cranial CT produced no unusual findings (). Moderate ST-segment depression was determined in lead II and aVF on treadmill exercise ECG. Ultrasound cardiography (UCG) indicated normal function with the left ventricular ejection fraction 69.4%. No unusual finding was found in chest X-ray. Blood myocardial enzyme, renal function, electrolytes, and D-dimer values were all within normal ranges.\nFive days later, the patient had coronary angiography examination. Coronary angiography revealed 80% stenosis of proximal segment and 85% stenosis of distal segment in left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, 90% stenosis of middle and distal segment in left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery, 50% stenosis of proximal segment, and 80% stenosis of middle segment in right coronary artery (RCA). The patient refused to have coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. So we decided to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). After balloon predilatation, 3.0 \u00d7 24 mm EXCEL rapamycin-eluting stent (Jiwei, Shandong, China) was implanted in RCA. A 2.5 \u00d7 14 mm EXCEL rapamycin-eluting stent and a 3.0 \u00d7 21 mm Partner sirolimus-eluting stent (Raisedragon, Peking, China) were implanted in distal and proximal segment of LAD, respectively. The further PCI was scheduled one week later for LCX. Unexpectedly, syncope occurred again. On the afternoon while sitting 2 days later, symptoms of dyspnea and palpation accompanied with hypotension occurred. Electrocardiogram monitor indicated that the heart rate was serious sinus bradycardia of nearly 30 bmp. Blood pressure was below 80/40 mmHg. The symptom disappeared after atropine and dopamine were infused. Consider the patient is a 64-year-old person with 30-year-long cigarettes intake history. We put a serum marker screen. Unexpectedly serum tumor marker results indicated that carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 72-4, and alpha fetoprotein are all within normal ranges whereas cytokeratin-19-fragment (CYFRA21-1) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) values elevated slightly (CYFRA21-1 3.75 ng/mL, normal <3.3 ng/mL; NSE 16.62 ng/mL, normal <16.3 ng/mL).\nExamination of enhanced chest CT led to suspicion of central lung cancer (). PET-CT confirmed the leaf of central type lung cancer (4.2 \u00d7 3.7 \u00d7 2.6 cm) of left lung with multiple lymph node metastasis and the tumor infiltration of adjacent thoracic aorta and left pulmonary artery and vein. No brain metastasis or heart metastasis was found on PET-CT examination. Immunohistochemical examination of the specimens collected with bronchoscopy revealed the following: CKpan(+), CKL(+), Syn(+), CgA(+), CD50(+), CD30(\u2212), CK20(\u2212), CK7(\u2212), CK5/6(\u2212), P63(\u2212), and Ki-67(+).\nThe diagnosis of small cell bronchogenic carcinoma was made; this tumor was clinically staged at T4N2M0 IIIB. Chemotherapy was promptly initiated with use of combination of carboplatin and topotecan. Shortly after the first chemotherapeutic infusion, the patient reported feeling much better. At follow-up a year later, enhanced CT scan showed that the tumour volume decreased and the patient did not experience syncope anymore.\n\nWhat is the patient's HEART score?", "output": "### Response:\n4", "task": "calc"}

She also suffered from alopecia and persistent/recurring respiratory infections. Both parents were reported to be healthy and they were consanguineous (first cousins). Their four children except for our patient were healthy.\nPhysical examination of the patient revealed normal vital signs. The percentiles of her weight and height were between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. She had pale skin, total alopecia and pitting in the nails of her hands and feet (). A crackling sound was heard during inspiration. Her puberty was stage I according to Tanner stages.\nHer hematology results revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit 19.9%, white blood cells 13200/mm3, platelets 35000/mm3, MCV 84fL and reticulocytes of 8.14%, as well as negative direct Coombs test result. Blood smear showed schistocytes (). Her biochemical investigation revealed: urea 142 mg/dL, creatinine 4.61 mg/dL, AST 97 U/L, ALT 79 U/L, LDH 2218 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.55 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 5.9 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, calcium 8.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.0 mg/dL, uric acid 8.0 mg/dL, ph 7.44, HCO3- 21 mmol/L and glucose 76 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed the following: pH 7.5, density 1010, protein (++), erythrocytes (+++), leucocytes (-) and dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urinary sediment.\nBased on these biochemical and urinary abnormalities, the patient was diagnosed as HUS. After seven plasma exchange sessions, the hemolysis finally stopped and the laboratory abnormalities and renal function reverted to normal. The respiratory infection was treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.\nIn the hormonal evaluation, free thyroxine (fT4) was 1.11 ng/dL (0.8-2.2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.028 mU/mL (0.6-5.5), anti-peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 62 IU/ mL (<20), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibody 65 IU/mL (<4.0), cortisol 25.5 mg/dL (3-21), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 28.1 pg/mL (10-60), estradiol 14 ng/dL (0.2.0), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.32 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.07 mIU/mL (0.02-0.3), anti-pancreatic islets antibody 1/100 (<1/10), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 65.9 ng/mL (10-65), renin 72 ng/L (5-35), aldosterone 248 pg/mL (20-300), vitamin B12 456 pg/mL (150-883) and folic acid 4.2 ng/mL (3.1-20.5) before plasma exchange therapy. Although thyroid ultrasonography was normal and the patient was not on Na-L-T4 treatment, both anti-TPO antibody and anti-TG antibody tests were positive. These findings suggested early diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis. Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation test (1 \u03bcg ACTH) was as follows: initial 1 mg/dL, 30th minute 8.1 mg/dL, 60th minute 11.2 mcg/dL, 90th minute 14.1 mg/dL, and 120th 14.7 mg/dL. The cut-off level of this test was 14 mg/dL (9). These results were interpreted as a normal response to ACTH stimulation test and indicated that there was no adrenal insufficiency. In immunological evaluation, IgA was 24 mg/dL (29-384), IgM 24 mg/dL (50-278), IgG 464 mg/dL (625-1579), IgE 464 IU/mL (0-170), C3 90 mg/dL (90-180), C4 26 mg/dL (10-40), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (-), anti-double strain DNA antibody (-), p-ANCA (-), c-ANCA (-) and anti-HBs (-) before plasma exchange therapy. Lymphocyte subsets were CD3 78% (55-78), CD19 2% (10-31), CD4 39% (27-53) and CD8 51% (19-34). The complement factor H gene region was proliferated by PCR method. Sequences which have single nucleotide polymorphism on complement factor H have been determined. CT homozygote polymorphism for His402Tyr was detected. This factor is considered to be a risk factor for development of HUS ().

She had a past medical history of Cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and myocardial infarction (MI). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed first-degree heart block, prolonged QT interval with anterolateral infarct. Echocardiograph (ECHO) showed an ejection fraction of 45\u201350%, left atrial enlargement, mild pulmonary hypertension, and trace mitral regurgitation.\nPreoperative airway assessment revealed a Mallampati score of IV, three finger breadth mouth opening, slight limitation of neck movement, and loose carious teeth. With this assessment, the patient was predicted to be difficult to intubate. The anesthetic plan included management of the predicted difficult intubation with the GlideScope\u00ae with other usual backup planes for difficult intubation.\nAnesthesia was induced with fentanyl 150 \u00b5g, lidocaine 100 mg, propofol 150 mg and succinylcholine 100 mg.\nThe GlideScope\u00ae blade tip was placed in the vallecula and the vocal cords and epiglottis were seen.

The endotracheal tube (ETT appeared to slide into the oropharynx with relative ease and the endotracheal tube was placed into the trachea. The stylet was removed, and positive EtCO2 and equal bilateral breath sounds was confirmed. A successful GlideScope\u00ae intubation was assumed.\nAs the surgeon began the procedure, he noticed that ETT had pierced and entered the tissue of the retromolar trigonum (the same space which holds the lingual nerve), and then proceeded to pass through the oropharyngeal space and re-enter the vocal cords [Figure and ].\nWe decided to remove ETT rather than cutting the tissues to free it, to avoid trauma to lingual nerve. We re-inserted another size 7 ETT with the aid of the GlideScope\u00ae camera. Positive EtCO2 and equal bilateral breath sounds was confirmed. Surgery was completed uneventfully; however, the surgeon stated multiple times that the patient's oral mucosa was very fragile and easily torn.

She was found to have a hemoglobin of 4.5 g/dL at that time. Testing revealed signs of hemolytic anemia, and she was treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and transfusions. Once her anemia stabilized, she was discharged home on steroids. She returned to the same hospital a few weeks later again with fatigue and now with new symptoms of severe back pain. Testing again showed anemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine was done for the back pain, and the results showed marrow abnormalities and a possible infarct of the L4 vertebrae. These abnormal findings directed physicians to perform a bone marrow biopsy which resulted several days later as DLBCL, activated B-cell type. The bone marrow morphology showed that the bone marrow spaces were almost entirely replaced by diffuse intermediate/large atypical appearing cells with a marked decrease of normal trilineage hematopoiesis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains on the biopsy demonstrated positivity for cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), CD79a, PAX5, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) (weakly), BCL6, MUM1 (30%), Ki67 (65%). IHC testing resulted as negative for CD3, CD10, CD34, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD30, CD117, and cyclin D1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for BCL2, BCL6, and MYC was attempted on the sample but was unsuccessful due to inability to hybridize. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan () had been done at the outside hospital, and results had shown diffuse osseous uptake in the axial and appendicular skeleton with no other sites of uptake. Based on these results, it was determined that she had PBML.

Infectious workup was negative except for a positive hepatitis B core Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was then performed and resulted as undetectable. Entecavir 0.5 mg daily was used throughout and after treatment as hepatitis B reactivation prophylaxis. Baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed normal cell counts and negative cytology. At this time, the decision was made to treat the patient with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, and alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine as per the R-Hyper-CVAD protocol. She underwent four cycles of this regimen, with several complications. Complications included anemia requiring frequent transfusions, vertebral compression fracture of T9 with significant pain and debility, several episodes of neutropenic fever, pericardial effusion without tamponade, and a superior sagittal thrombus treated with 6 months of anticoagulation with apixaban. Some of these complications did result in delays in her treatment. The patient also completed six treatments of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate throughout the course of therapy.\nAfter completion of all her treatments, the patient underwent another bone marrow biopsy as well as another PET scan (). Both showed evidence of a CR. At the time of this writing, the patient is 1 year out from the time of her diagnosis.

Recurrent HCC was diagnosed, and retroperitoneal laparoscopic hepatectomy was performed with the patient\u2019s full knowledge and consent. Seventy-two hours before the operation, indocyanine green was injected through the peripheral vein at 0.25 mg/kg body weight (ICG-r15 = 13.4%).\nPatient position: Left recumbent position with a high waist cushion. Port site: A 2.0 cm incision was made under the costal margin of the right posterior axillary line, and a finger was inserted into the retroperitoneal cavity for blunt separation. A 1.0 cm incision was made on the iliac crest of the right midaxillary line, and a 0.5 cm incision was made under the front ribs on the right axillary line. Intraoperative procedure: Under fluorescent laparoscopic surveillance, an ultrasound scalpel was used to separate the retroperitoneal space to avoid incision of the peritoneum and to locate the right posterior lobe of the liver. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) was used for localization, and ICG fluorescence was used for navigation. Ultimately, the tumour was completely removed.

Hepatitis serology and ANA screen were negative. He had undergone Liver biopsy was performed during surgery which was found normal without any changes of cirrhosis of liver ().\nOn upper GI endoscopy (EGD) esophageal and stomach mucosa were found normal without any active sites of bleeding. Fundus was clearly seen without varices. Pylorus was patent and the duodenal bulb was normal. The major papilla was identified in the descending duodenum and had normal appearance. Just distal to the major papilla in the 2nd portion of duodenum, there was a large submucosal bulge suspicious for an ectopic duodenal varix (). On withdrawal of the scope findings were confirmed.\nAbdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast showed massive gastric distention. Gastric outlet obstruction was suspected. Pancreatic Pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas had significantly increased in size from the previous study. Changes of chronic pancreatitis were present.\nMesenteric Arteriogram showed slow contrast filling of the superior mesenteric vein with significant limiting of flow. Superior Mesenteric Vein obstruction was suspected. Multiple venous varicosities around the distal stomach and the pancreatic head region were found (). Possibility of at least partial thrombosis of the Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) near the pancreatic head region was suspected secondary to pancreatitis. Splenic vein was found of normal caliber without any varicosities.\nPatient had undergone end to side Mesocaval Anastomosis with a Dacron 10 mm graft between the Superior Mesenteric Vein and the Inferior Vena Cava along with adhesionolysis and liver biopsy. During surgery no varicosities found in the gastric and esophageal region or no dilation found in the splenic or inferior mesenteric venous system. There were multiple adhesions found in the tail region of pancreas possibly because of previous Cystojejunostomy in that area. Similarly many adhesions found in the peripancreatic region most likely due to changes of chronic pancreatitis. Patient was discharged without any complications and found asymptomatic in the follow up visits with normal hemoglobin level and without any evidence of bleeding. Considering the young age of the patient and relatively absent varices at other sites Mesocaval shunt surgery was chosen as a treatment over Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) and duodenal resection.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?", "output": "### Response:\n299.333", "task": "calc"}

There was no family medical history. The patient was married, had two children, and worked as a social worker. He did not consume alcohol nor tobacco. The only treatment was l-thyroxine 50 \u00b5g/day.\nLaboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 3.9 \u00d7 109L, with neutrophils at 1.5 \u00d7 109/L and monocytes at 1.49 \u00d7 109/L, a platelet count of 113 \u00d7 109/L, and hemoglobin at 115 g/L. The bone-marrow blast count was 1.4%, and cytogenetics were normal, with no Philadelphia chromosome. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected a SETBP1 mutation, with a variant allelic fraction (VAF) of 0.21%. Biological and clinical monitoring was decided.\nIn December 2019, a brutal deterioration of the general state, with a loss of 13 kg, night sweats, major fatigue, and loss of appetite, raised doubts about the diagnosis. The patient\u2019s body temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C, heart rate 95 beats per minute, blood pressure 103/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 100% on ambient air. Cardiopulmonary auscultation was normal. He was conscious, oriented, and had a Glasgow score of 15, without detectable abnormalities on neurological clinical examination. His weight was 60.5 kg. Laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 29.7 \u00d7 109/L, with neutrophils at 23.46 \u00d7 109/L and monocytes at 1.78 \u00d7 109/L, a platelet count of 83 \u00d7 109/L, and hemoglobin at 78 g/L. Another medullary aspiration was performed and showed major dysplasia without excess blasts and a cytological aspect of CMML-0. Immunophenotyping showed a near-absence of type MO3 monocytes, consistent with a diagnosis of CMML. A PET scan was performed and detected several deep lymphadenopathies with moderate hypermetabolism [maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) 3.6]. They had a maximum size of 12 mm and were not puncturable. There was no evidence of another cancer. Treatment with hydroxyurea (three tablets per day) was introduced for the hyperleukocytosis and was administered over 3 weeks.\nIn January 2020, the appearance of psychomotor slowdown led to admission to the hematology department of Tours Hospital. Subsequently, the patient\u2019s condition quickly worsened with the occurrence of severe problems of alertness and aphasia. At this time, clinical examination showed a Glasgow score of 11 (M6V2E3), with bilateral nonreactive myosis and right central facial paralysis. There was no motor or sensory deficit of the limbs within the limits of clinical examination in such a state of consciousness.\nLaboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 77 g/L, a platelet count of 36 \u00d7 109/L, and a leukocyte count of 37 \u00d7 109/L, with neutrophils at 31 \u00d7 109/L and monocytes at 3 \u00d7 109/L (Table ). Infectious assessment was negative, with sterile hemocultures in bacteriology and mycology and negative serologies for Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma, HIV, HBV, HBC, CMV, EBV, and syphilis. Beta-d-glucan assessment was negative. Autoimmune assessment, including for ANA, was also negative. Cerebral CT showed multiple hemorrhagic nodular lesions (Fig. A). On MRI (Fig. B\u2013C) these CNS lesions were heterogeneous, without enhancement after gadolinium administration. The MRI also showed multiple supra- and infratentorial hemorrhagic lesions of varying age, in favor of leukemic infiltration as well as the beginning of left temporal engagement (Fig. B\u2013D). We could not perform a lumbar puncture because of the risk of engagement. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, consisting of 100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone per day, was introduced, and the patient was transferred to intensive care because of his worsening state of consciousness. A neurosurgical diagnosis could not be performed owing to the nontissular hemorrhagic description of the lesions by imaging. The patient died on 15 January 2020.\nAn autopsy was performed. Macroscopic sections of the brain showed multiple hemorrhagic lesions (Fig. A). Microscopic analyses showed infiltration by relatively immature myeloid elements and hemorrhagic phenomena (Fig. B). Immunohistochemistry analyses of the brain tissue showed positivity of the lesion for antibodies against CD15 (Fig. C) and MPO (Fig. D). No megakaryocytic or erythrocytic precursors were found in the brain (not shown). However, adenopathy (Fig. E) exhibited a predominance of myeloid polymorphic localization and mature elements with megakaryocytes (Fig. F\u2013G), and elements of erythrocytic lineage (not shown) were also found. No blastic elements were found in the node (Fig. H) or other localizations (not shown). The bone marrow (Fig. I\u2013J) exhibited a predominance of a myelomonocytic line, but no immature cells. The spleen, lungs, and liver contained mostly myeloid and monocytic elements, without megakaryocytes (not shown). These various elements suggest brain, splenic, liver, lung, and lymph node localization of myelomonocytic leukemia, without any evidence for evolution of the CMML to acute leukemia.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n100.5", "task": "calc"}

Laboratory evaluation revealed follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and estradiol serum levels of 21.2 mIL/mL, 22.6 mIL/mL, and 46.5 pg/mL, respectively. Serum testosterone was elevated at 1,032 ng/dL, and chromosomal analysis confirmed a normal male 46, XY karyotype. The patient was diagnosed with CAIS. Gonadectomy was recommended because of the malignant transformation potential of occult testicular elements. We performed bilateral gonadectomy through the inguinal approach, which allowed easy access to the testes in both inguinal canals. The surgery was uncomplicated, and pathological examination of the gonads showed Leydig cell hyperplasia and only Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules at both sides ().

She had visited a pediatrics division at another hospital because she experienced restriction in the range of the motion in both elbow joints, and clubfoot. When the patient was 3 years old, she was diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis due to proteinuria. At the age of 7 years, she was diagnosed with MCTO based on multiple osteolysis and a typical facial appearance associated with a small forehead and hypotelorism. At the age of 18 years, she underwent genetic testing; a MafB missense polymorphic mutation was identified, and a definitive diagnosis was established. Scoliosis was apparent since she was 12 years old, but she had not sought treatment until the age of 19. The patient weighed 38.6 kg and had a height of 155 cm. Medical examination showed a typical facial appearance associated with a small forehead and hypotelorism; shortening of the fingers of both hands fingers and both upper limbs were observed in addition to clubfoot. No caf\u00e9 au lait spots or mental retardation were seen. On the other hand, the trunk showed evidence of an irregular waistline and a rib hump that obviously suggested scoliosis (Fig. ).\nDue to the remarkable deformation of upper limbs beyond the elbow joint, upper limb muscular strength could not be evaluated accurately. Further, due to the remarkable deformation of lower limbs beyond the ankle joint, lower limb muscular strength could not be evaluated accurately. Other muscle weakness was not present. There were no walking problems. No hypoesthesia, numbness, or dysuria was found. Hyperreflexia was observed in the upper and lower limbs, but no neurological deficit was observed. No laterality was found in the limbs and Babinski reflex was positive. Spirometry showed a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) by 67.4%. Although proteinuria was observed, no renal dysfunction or hypertension was present.\nX-ray images of the limbs showed remarkable osteolysis in joints of the hand, elbow, and ankle (Fig. ).\nThe major curve of scoliosis was 82\u00b0 (MC, Th7-L2; Th11 apical vertebra), and the upper curve was 77\u00b0 ay (UC, Th1-6; Th3 apical vertebra).

A week before, he had undergone a mitral valvuloplasty and Maze operation for severe mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. The patient had a history of hypertension and bronchial asthma. A follow-up ECG after the open heart surgery showed a sinus rhythm with a normal QTc interval (). Postoperative follow-up echocardiography showed mild mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 49%. Laboratory studies returned normal findings except for a prothrombin time of 2.20 international normalized ratio (INR) due to warfarin therapy. Electrolytes including potassium (4.2 mmol/L), magnesium (1.9 mg/dl) and ionized calcium (0.95 mmol/L) were within normal limits. No preoperative antibiotics were given.\nFor the emergency appendectomy, the patient was not premedicated. Monitoring included non-invasive blood pressure determination, ECG (lead II), pulse oximetry, and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO2) measurement. The vital signs included a blood pressure (BP) of 125/75 mmHg, a regular sinus rhythm heart rate (HR) of 85 beats/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. Anesthesia was induced using mask administration of 100% oxygen. Etomidate (12 mg) and rocuronium (40 mg) were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated using an 8.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube.\nAnesthesia was maintained using 1 L/min O2, 1 L/min N2O, and 1.5-2.0 vol% sevoflurane. Ventilation was mechanically performed at a tidal volume of 600 ml and a rate of 12 breath/min. The ETCO2 was maintained between 31-35 mmHg. At the commencement of surgery, the patient had a BP of 100/65 mmHg, a regular sinus rhythm HR of 95 beats/min and 100% SpO2. The operation took approximately 1 hour, and proceeded unremarkably. The neuromuscular blocker was then reversed using 15 mg pyridostigmine and 0.4 mg glycopyrrolate. Extubation was performed without complications. At that time, the patient had a BP of 140/100 mmHg, 100% SpO2, and the ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a HR of 160 beats/min. As the patient recovered from anesthesia completely including alert mentation, spontaneous breathing, reversal of muscle tone, he was transferred to the PACU.\nWhile applying the monitoring instrument immediately after entering the PACU, the patient lost consciousness, ceased spontaneous breathing and a carotid pulse could not be palpated. BP was unmeasurable, the SpO2 was 36% and the ECG showed ventricular fibrillation. Mask ventilation was promptly initiated using an ambu-bag, chest compression was performed, and a direct current of 360 J was applied 3 times using a monophasic defibrillator. The ECG showed resolution of the ventricular fibrillation and appearance of a sinus rhythm. However, shortly thereafter TdP-type polymorphic ventricular tachycardia developed (). Defibrillation was performed 3 times, and 1 mg epinephrine and 110 mg lidocaine were intravenously administered. Additionally, magnesium sulfate 2 g was given intravenously over 10 min. The sinus rhythm returned with a HR of 80 beats/min, the BP increased to 166/80 mmHg and the SpO2 to 95%. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) with endotracheal intubation in a stable condition. The BP was 110/67 mmHg, the SpO2 was 98%, and an ECG showed QTc interval prolongation (617 ms) and a HR of 111 beats/min on arrival at the ICU. Norepinephrine (0.04 \u00b5g/kg/min), isosorbide dinitrate (1 \u00b5g/kg/min) and magnesium sulfate (2 g) were administered intravenously. The vital signs stabilized and norepinephrine infusion was ceased at 3 hours after ICU arrival. There was no necessity for supplement of electrolytes during ICU care, because all electrolytes were within normal limits including potassium (4.1 mmol/L), magnesium (2.2 mg/dl) and ionized calcium (0.9 mmol/L). In addition, no other drugs known to prolong QTc interval were administered. The patient was moved to the general ward on the 3rd postoperative day without relapse of TdP.\nWe retrospectively investigated the QTc interval and Tpeak-Tend interval (Tpe interval) identified on the ECG data ().

Her peritoneal dialysis regime included 2,000 ml of 1.5% peritoneal dialysis solution (Dianeal 1.5%, Baxter, International Inc.) with three exchanges daily (PD2) and 2,000 ml of 2.5% PDF overnight (PD2). Her daily peritoneal dialysis ultrafiltration volume was 500\u2013800 ml and her urine output was 800\u20131,000 ml/24 h. The patient denied having had any systemic diseases or a history of allergic or infectious diseases. In general, her CAPD therapy went well during the past 30 months, and the peritoneal dialysis effluent was always clear.\nFrom May 2014, the patient observed cloudy peritoneal effluent without abdominal pain or fever. The ultrafiltration volume was stable. An effluent cytological study and bacterial/fungal culture were demanded before the antibiotic application. The former showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 630 \u00d7 106/l, with 80% polynuclear cells, while the latter was negative. Despite all treatments, such as peritoneal lavage, diagnostic antibiotic treatment by intraperitoneal injection of aminoglycosides (amikacin) combined with first-generation cephalosporins (cefazolin) for 14 days, the effluent was still turbid. The second peritoneal fluid culture was performed 10 days after the antibiotic application, which was, however, still negative; thus, a bacterial/fungal culture was demanded. Therefore, we changed the antibiotic regime of intraperitoneal injection of ceftazidime and vancomycin to 21 days. Intraperitoneal urokinase 5,000 IU/l was also added to each dialysate. There was still no improvement of the turbidness, but the ultrafiltration was always stable. The patient was hospitalized in July 2014.\nOur 43-year-old patient weighed 65 kg and measured 165 cm (BMI 23.8). Her blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 80 bpm. There was no rash or purpura. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Abdominal palpation revealed no tenderness, tension or rebound pain, and no lower extremity edema was found.\nIn July 2014, the complete blood count (CBC) revealed a WBC count of 3.8 \u00d7 109/l, with 32.2% eosinophils, and there were up to 500 \u00d7 106/l leukocytes in the peritoneal effluent, with 87% eosinophils. The absolute eosinophil count was 435/mm3 (before the antibiotic application). The peritoneal effluent culture showed no growth of aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, or fungi, and negativity for acid-fast stain. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the antibiotics were then stopped.\nGiven the fact that there was a significant elevation of eosinophils in the peritoneal effluent with a ratio of 87% and an absolute eosinophil count of >30/mm3 (up to 435/mm3), the patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic peritonitis (EP). The etiological examinations included repeated effluent bacteria, fungi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection and cultivation; serum tumor markers, serum immunological markers like ANA, ENA and ANCA, and blood allergen tests were all negative. Chest and abdominal injected computed tomography did not reveal any sign of malignancy. However, there was a slight elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (table ).\nKetotifen (1 mg daily p.o.) was given as anti-allergic treatment along with low-dose oral corticosteroid therapy. The patient commenced oral prednisone acetate with a daily dose of 20 mg. Over the next 24 h, her peritoneal dialysis effluent became clear. Prednisone acetate was rapidly reduced and stopped over a 2-week period, but 3 days after that, the peritoneal dialysis effluent turned turbid again. Thus, we restarted a low dose of prednisone acetate (20 mg daily p.o.), which was gradually weaned off and stopped over an 8-week period. During the therapy course, the patient had no complaint of abdominal pain, and the dialysis fluid remained clear. In September 2014, we reanalyzed the dialysis effluent cytology demonstrating that the polynuclear cell count decreased to 1 \u00d7 106/l, with no eosinophils (fig. ).

Gradually her sensorium improved and she recovered from the acute illness. However she had residual left lower limb monoparesis. She was started on oral sodium benzoate, thiamine, biotin and carnitine and continued on the same.\nOver next six months she gradually improved and achieved normal development except in gross motor domain. By two years of age she was speaking with two word sentences and achieved bowel control. She was able to walk with support. Over the next 4 to 4\u00bd years period, she was regularly followed up for continuation of medications, development assessment, nutritional management and rehabilitation. She had three more acute episodes with vomiting and lethargy that required admissions and intravenous fluids. At 6.5 years of age, she was performing well at school and had good interaction with parents and peers. However she had weakness in the lower limbs and required assistance in walking. At this stage, her urine was subjected to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, which revealed elevated methylmalonic acid. Tandem mass spectrometry showed significantly elevated propionyl carnitine and normal amino acid profile.\nGenomic DNA was extracted from mother and proband. Direct sequencing of all the coding exons including flanking introns of MUT, MMAA and MMAB was carried out as described previously.[] Alignment of amino acid sequences of methylmalonic aciduria type A protein was carried out by Clustal W () as per the Entrez Protein database. SIFT and Polyphen are in silico tools which are used to predict the effect of amino acids substitutions. SIFT predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids.[] Polyphen predicts the amino acid substitution based on the structure and function of a human protein using straightforward physical and comparative considerations.[] The missense mutation was submitted to SIFT () and PolyPhen ().\nIn exon 6 of MMAA, a G to A substitution at position 833 was found in a homozygous pattern (c.833G > A) []. This mutation leads to the substitution of glycine by aspartic acid at position 278 (p.G278D). The mother showed the same mutation in a heterozygous pattern.\nEffects of missense mutation were predicted by SIFT and Polyphen. According to SIFT tool, the substitution at position 278 from G to D is predicted to affect protein function with a score of 0.02 (amino acids with probabilities <0.05 are predicted to be deleterious). According to the Polyphen, this variant is predicted to be probably damaging. Alignment of amino acids sequence of methylmalonic aciduria type A protein observed in the patient (resulting in a change of glycine to aspartic acid residue at position 278) showed it to be highly conserved across other species [].\nPresently she is on daily oral supplementation of vitamin B12 one milligram and carnitine 500 mg. She is now 7 years and has normal intellectual functions and residual weakness in left lower limb.\nDuring her mother's subsequent pregnancy, prenatal diagnosis was done at 12 weeks of gestation. Same mutation was confirmed in the fetus in homozygous state and she discontinued the pregnancy.\n\nWhat is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?", "output": "### Response:\n248.889", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA three and half year old male child was referred to our department for DMSA scintigraphy for evaluation of renal scarring. Renal function tests (RFTs) were within normal limits (Blood Urea Nitrogen: 12 mg/dl, Serum Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dl). Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and renal ultrasonography (USG KUB) were also normal except for mild left hydronephrosis. 60 MBq of Tc-99m DMSA was administered IV after adequate hydration and the scintigraphy was performed 3 hours later. The anterior and posterior images showed no definite delineation of renal cortical outline with high background tracer activity and hence pinhole images could not be acquired []. The child had no recent history of UTI to suggest any recent acute renal insult. A detailed enquiry then revealed that the child is a suspected case of Lowe's syndrome and had bilateral cataracts operated in his first year of age, history of global developmental delay and abnormal behavioral pattern. Biochemical analysis revealed hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) and alkaline urine with associated hyperphosphaturia, hypercalciuria, nonselective aminoaciduria, and glycosuria indicative of Fanconi type of proximal renal tubular acidosis. Suspecting the proximal tubular disorder as the cause of the discrepancy, an EC renal dynamic study was performed. Sequential dynamic images were acquired in posterior view after intravenous administration of 65 MBq of Tc-99m EC. Dynamic imaging showed adequate perfusion and renal cortical tracer uptake of both kidneys along with adequate background tracer clearance indicating adequate renal function []. This case depicts the key role of proximal renal tubule membrane integrity in the uptake of DMSA.\n\nUsing the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "output": "### Response:\n162.997", "task": "calc"}

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 77-year-old man with right renal calculi measuring 1.0 \u00d7 0.8 cm underwent primary ESWL with satisfactory efficacy. Follow-up renal ultrasound showed no remaining calculi. Although he felt pain in the abdomen at the time of ESWL, he paid little attention to it. Five days later, his abdominal pain had worsened and he was admitted to the emergency department. Physical examination showed significant tenderness of the abdomen and high blood pressure of 176/105 mmHg. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a contained rupture of the abdominal aorta with a retroperitoneal hematoma (33 \u00d7 25 mm) around the periaortic area. More remarkably, a disruptive calcified plaque was found at the level between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae (). The patient reported that his medical history included smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Liver function, renal function, lipid and blood parameters, and other routine laboratory examination findings were within the reference range.\nPreoperative CT angiography demonstrated normal morphology of the abdominal aorta, renal artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Based on the patient\u2019s history and CT results, we suspected rupture of the abdominal aorta after ESWL. We identified the contained rupture, which was essentially a pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta. The size of the hematoma was 33 \u00d7 25 mm (). Considering the risk of mortality associated with a ruptured abdominal aorta, we performed endovascular aortic repair. Preoperative preparation included strict bed rest and control of the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg. The surgery was performed in the digital subtraction angiography room under general anesthesia. Open femoral exposure was performed, and a pigtail catheter was inserted to the aorta. Aortic angiography showed the location of the aortic lesions. However, no extravasation of contrast agent was found in the abdominal aorta, possibly because of a minor intimal tear.\nThrough the right common femoral artery, a 26-26-80-mm Ankura stent graft (Lifetech Scientific Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was placed with its proximal end immediately below the renal arteries. The stent graft was deployed successfully, and the abdominal aortic area between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae was completely covered (). The patient had an uneventful recovery with effective blood pressure control and infection prevention measures during postoperative follow-up. One week after the operation, enhanced CT revealed that the size of the hematoma around the periaortic area had remained constant, and repeat enhanced CT 1 month later showed that the hematoma had been significantly absorbed ().\nThe patient was treated at our hospital from March 2012 to May 2016.

At the casualty department, bilateral chest tubes were inserted. At presentation, the patient was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26/min, blood pressure was 124/88 mmHg with a heart rate between 125 and 136 beats/min. He was resuscitated with fluids. An initial hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL was documented.\nThe patient underwent an emergency laparotomy with small bowel resection and end-to-end anastomosis at 13 hours posttrauma. Following this, minimally invasive percutaneous instrumentation from T10 to T12 was done. Four percutaneous screws were inserted simultaneously through four stab incisions []. The instrumentation was performed using size 5.5 mm screws for both T10 as well as T12 vertebrae. The duration of the operation was 45 min, with a blood loss of 75 mls (measured by soaked gauze). The screws were inserted simultaneously to reduce the amount of image intensifier exposures required for the procedure. The total exposure (Siemens Siremobil 2000) was 25 exposures at 75\u201390 kV peak and 1.5\u20132.0 mA. Intraoperatively, 2 units of packed red blood cells were transfused. Intraoperative hemoglobin was maintained at 10.0 g/dL. No hemodynamic instability or hypoxic episodes were documented intraoperatively.\nPostoperatively, the patient was allowed to turn to his side every two hourly and was also allowed to be propped up on day 1. On postoperative day 3, once the abdominal and chest drains were removed, the patient was allowed to sit up and stand independently.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nThe present case report is of a 32-week- and 4-day-old female fetus through cesarean section at Mahzad Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Urmia, Iran. The mother had a history of miscarriage and a normal delivery at the age of 32. She was also from a family with a good socioeconomic status resided in Urmia city. During this pregnancy, she had regularly visited a gynecologist for receiving health examinations, in which the fetus was shown to be completely healthy on a color Doppler ultrasound. The mother did not mention any particular drug history and also denied a history of substance or alcohol use. However, she mentioned a history of smoking (one cigarette a day for 10 years).\nAfter the onset of labor signs and contractions, the mother went to the hospital and gave birth to a 32-week-and 4-day-old female fetus with a birth weight of 1800 g, height of 42 cm, and head circumference of 32 cm. Vital signs of the infant at birth were as follows: Temperature: 36.7, Heart Rate: 163 bpm, Respiration Rate: 66 bpm, Blood Pressure: 63/24 mmHg, Oxygen Saturation: 98%. The infant's Apgar score was 7 and 8 at birth and 5 min after birth, respectively. Concerning the preterm birth and respiratory distress, the infant was transferred to the NICU and placed in an incubator at an appropriate temperature. On the first day after birth, the infant underwent a chest radiograph, the results of which showed no health problem (). After sterile pre-procedural prepping and draping, a trained nurse first inserted the PICC into the basilic vein using a special angiocatheter and directed it into the vein using an angiocatheter guide (). Then the catheter (the Arrowg+ard Blue Advance\u2122 PICC made in United States country), was pushed from the catheter insertion site to the middle of the clavicle bone and then to the mid-sternal region. Finally, the catheter was fixed with an IV fixing bandage (sterile disposable cannula catheter fixing IV Non-woven dressing made in China). After the PICC placement, the infant underwent an anterior-posterior chest X-ray again and a neonatologist confirmed the correct placement of the PICC tip in the SVC. In addition, the catheter insertion site was dressed with a sterile transparent dressing based on the medical protocol to make the catheter insertion site visible and timely diagnose local complications. Two hours after the PICC placement, the infant's oxygen saturation decreased and her vital signs changed as follows: Temperature: 36.9, Heart Rate: 199 bpm, Respiration Rate: 76 bpm, Blood Pressure: 60/25 mmHg, Oxygen Saturation: 45%. Despite 8-liter-per-minute oxygen therapy using an oxygen tent, oxygen saturation did not increase so that the patient received Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) ventilation with the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) = 80% and the Positive End-Expiratory Pressure = 5 cm H2O. The infant underwent a chest radiograph again, in which the presence of a complete white-out of the right hemithorax indicated pneumothorax and right lung collapse (). Moreover, the reduction of right lung sounds indicated a collapse of the right lung, because of which a chest tube (disposable medical closed chest drainage bottle made in china) was immediately placed in this region.\n\nWhat is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "output": "### Response:\n37.0", "task": "calc"}

Her enteric symptoms were vague and unquantifiable. She was obese and had a past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for 15 years, hypertension, asthma, and depression. Her regular medication comprised metformin 3g daily, modified-release gliclazide 60mg daily, aspirin 100mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily, ramipril 10mg daily, and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. Our patient was brought into hospital by ambulance; her pre-hospital observations were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale score, 15; blood sugar level, 2.8mmol/L; blood pressure, 90/40mmHg; pulse, 54 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and peripheral oxygen saturation, 98% on 8L oxygen via a variable oxygen delivery mask. On arrival to our emergency department, she was confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 out of 15 (E4V4M6), with the rest of her physiological parameters similar to her pre-hospital observations.\nHer initial investigations were as follows: serum sodium, 140mmol/L (normal range: 137 to 145mmol/L); serum potassium, 7.3mmol/L (normal range: 3.5 to 4.9mmol/L); serum chloride, 91mmol/L (normal range: 100 to 109mmol/L); serum bicarbonate, 1mmol/L (normal range: 22 to 32mmol/L); anion gap, 55mmol/L (normal range: 7 to 17mmol/L); serum glucose, 2.3mmol/L; urea, 30.8mmol/L (normal range: 2.7 to 8.0mmol/L); and serum creatinine, 768umol/L (normal range: 50 to 100umol/L). Results from liver function tests were normal. Her troponin level was 50ng/L (normal range: <30ng/L). Venous blood gas measurements revealed a profound metabolic acidemia: pH, 6.58; partial pressure of CO2, 38.6mmHg; HCO3, 3.6mmol/L; glucose, 2.0mmol/L; and lactate, 16.7mmol/L. Her initial resuscitation strategy included 2000mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate, 15 units insulin (Actrapid) in 50mL 50% dextrose, and 1mL/kg of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution.\nMinutes after these initial investigations, our patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was managed as per advanced life support protocol. She had a total downtime of 25 minutes. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation she was intubated and ventilated. Following return of spontaneous circulation, she required an infusion of adrenaline for blood pressure support. She had an unremarkable chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and toxicology screen.\nWith a presumed diagnosis of ischemic bowel based on vague abdominal features and profound lactatemia, our patient was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for preoperative optimization. In our ICU, she was sedated and ventilated on an inspired oxygen concentration of 40% and on modest ventilator paramters (peak inspiratory pressure <25cmH2O). To treat her severe circulatory shock, she was fluid-resuscitated with a total of 10,000mL crystalloid from a central venous pressure of 8cmH2O to 16cmH2O. In addition, she required very high doses of noradrenaline and adrenaline. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was commenced at exchange rates of 50mL/kg/h using Hemosol B0 solution. She was empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam (Tazocin) as broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover.\nOur patient went to theater 26 hours post admission for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed no significant findings. We continued her broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover despite negative microbiological cultures. Renal replacement therapy continued and our patient\u2019s acid-base balance slowly normalized over three days. Having excluded all causes of a high anion gap lactic acidosis, including negative red blood cell transketolase activity for thiamine deficiency, we presumed our patient to have had a severe MALA \u2018triggered\u2019 by an acute kidney injury from dehydration. This was supported by a serum metformin level of 4mg/L.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension by a private clinic in August 2013, based upon a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and she was prescribed antihypertensive drugs to treat the condition. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and losartan 50 mg daily. After 1 week, her blood pressure was still high, so the doctor changed her medication to amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and indapamide 2.5 mg per day. Five days after initiating this second regimen of drugs, she developed pretibial pitting edema, and thorough workup was done for the symptom. There were bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT). Routine blood tests revealed the following: potassium 2.2 mmol/L, plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.12 ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 16.76 ng/dL, and an aldosterone/renin ratio (PAC/PRA) >30, indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.\nFollowing her possible diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism, the patient was referred to our hospital for additional testing. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 155/111 mm Hg, height was 164.5 cm, and weight was 63.5 kg (body mass index, 23.47 kg/m2). Pretibial pitting edemas were detected, but no physical signs of Cushing syndrome were observed.\nA routine blood test at the time of admission showed the following: white blood cell 6,900/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet 351,000/\u00b5L, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 76 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 126 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 7.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, total cholesterol 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 104 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 50 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 141 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c 5.9%. Biochemical evaluation of pheochromocytoma showed no excessive catecholamine production. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient was 12.64%, suggesting the possibility of hyperaldosteronism or hypercortisolism. PAC and PRA were 24.4 ng/dL and 0.76 ng/mL/hr, respectively, and the PAC/PRA ratio was 32.11 (). After correcting for hypokalemia, a saline loading test was performed, which revealed no suppression of the aldosterone level after saline administration, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism (the basal PAC 24.4 ng/dL increased to 27.3 ng/dL after a 2 L saline infusion). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) resulted in no suppression of cortisol levels (). Adrenal CT demonstrated two bilateral adrenal masses in each of the adrenal glands, including a 1.6-cm mass on the right and a 2-cm mass on the left adrenal gland (). An adrenal cortical scan using iodine-131-6\u03b2-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) showed focally increased radioactive uptakes in the bilateral adrenal gland areas, with a substantially higher uptake on the left side ().\nBilateral adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation () revealed inadequate right adrenal venous blood sampling (right adrenal vein cortisol level/peripheral blood cortisol level [CRt/CP] <10), whereas the cortisol concentration in the left adrenal venous blood showed successful sampling on the left side. One explanation for this difference may be that the low level of CRt was the result of suppressed cortisol secretion due to excessive cortisol secretion from the left adrenal mass. The left adrenal vein aldosterone/cortisol (ALt/CLt) ratio was lower than that of peripheral blood, implying the possibility of suppressed aldosterone secretion from this side caused by a contralateral adrenal mass which might secrete excessive aldosterone []. Four days after the first AVS, a second AVS was performed using low-dose DST but without ACTH infusion (). This time, we also measured the epinephrine levels in the both adrenal veins and peripheral blood; a large peripheral-to-adrenal gradient of epinephrine assured successful catheterization on both sides []. CLt/CP testing confirmed that the left adrenal mass was a cortisol-secreting adenoma [].\nEven though those two AVS results appeared to provide clear evidence of the lateralization of functioning adrenal masses, such an independent functioning of bilateral masses was highly suspicious. We therefore concluded that sequential adrenalectomies, rather than concurrent operations, would be beneficial for making a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, the patient agreed to do sequential operations. The first procedure was a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy of the right adrenal gland to remove the putative aldosterone-producing mass, with the goal of controlling hypertension and hypokalemia. A firm, 1.5-cm ovoid, well-circumscribed, bright yellow tumor mass lacking necrosis or hemorrhage was arising from the cortex of the adrenal gland in the pathologic specimen. Within 24 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure had fallen to 110/80 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, serum potassium normalized at 4.5 mmol/L, and PAC decreased to 3 ng/dL. These large postoperative changes strongly suggested that the right adrenal adenoma was producing excessive aldosterone. By day 3, an overnight DST continued to show no cortisol suppression, indicating persistent secretion of corticosteroid from the left adrenal mass. To limit the likelihood of subclinical Cushing syndrome progressing to overt Cushing syndrome, we opted to completely remove the left adrenal gland as a means of controlling hypercortisolism. The excised portion of the adrenal mass contained an encapsulated brown solid mass.\nThe patient began taking prednisolone 10 mg once a day for steroid replacement 1 day after the second surgery. By 2 months she had lost 5 kg of body weight. At that time, a rapid ACTH test revealed adrenal insufficiency (). At 16 months after surgery, the patient has gradually reduced her prednisolone intake to 5 mg every other day. Her blood pressure and serum potassium levels have remained within normal ranges, without the need for additional antihypertensive medications or potassium supplements.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n103.5", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nA three-year-old female with a history of complex congenital heart disease and previous cardiac surgeries was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in shock that progressed to cardiopulmonary arrest requiring resuscitation due to thrombosis in her right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit. She subsequently demonstrated evidence of severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI), of which the latter resolved.\nThe main reason for her subsequent PICU stay was for neurological rehabilitation and transition to home ventilation. She was receiving treatment for dystonia, heart failure, endocarditis, and pulmonary embolism. At the request of the parents, stem cell therapy for neurological dysfunction was investigated. As metformin has shown properties to recruit existing neural stem cells and enhance neural functions, a trial of therapy was initiated. The patient was placed on metformin (20 mg/kg) 17 days before the event, which was increased to 40 mg/kg (250 mg twice-daily) six days prior to the event.\nOn the day of the event, the patient acutely presented with a new wide complex bradycardia 70\u201380 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 110\u2013120 bpm and peaked T waves. The other vital signs were blood pressure = 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate = 26 breaths per minute, temperature = 37.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation = 87% on her baseline ventilation settings. She was poorly perfused with prolonged capillary refill time and lethargic. Immediate and subsequent venous blood sampling showed severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia [].\nShe was managed for hyperkalemia, and propranolol was discontinued. She became hypotensive, requiring dopamine and norepinephrine infusions, and higher ventilator support. The patient\u2019s clinical status improved within three hours, and support therapies were weaned towards the baseline. Twelve hours after the initial event, a similar episode recurred with a rise in serum lactate and hyperkalemia, which was treated similarly and resolved. A detailed review of both events demonstrated that they occurred 1 to 2 hours after the administration of metformin. In addition, her creatinine levels had doubled five days prior to the event with a recent increment in metformin dose six days before.\nAt this point, metformin was discontinued.

The patient had no fever, cough, sore throat, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.\nThe patient had no previous history of chronic diseases such as kidney disease, hypertension, and an endocrine disorder; muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy and neuromuscular disorders; or a statin class of drug use that could lead to muscle breakdown. There was no trauma and no history of medication. The patient reported no alcohol intake and smoking.\nBlood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/minutes, heart rate 93/minutes, temperature 36.7\u00b0C, and arterial oxygen saturation 98% in room air. The patient was conscious and had a clear mind. He was in a regular heart rhythm without any obvious murmur. There were obvious moist crackles during auscultation of inferior lobes in the lung.\nRoutine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 2.91 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils, 55.7%; lymphocytes, 30.2%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.88 \u00d7 109/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 35.1 mg/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; sodium, 138 mmol/L; urea, 21 mg/dL; D-dimer, 210 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 52 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 117 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 575 U/L; ferritin, 428 ng/mL; international normalized ratio, 1.07; prothrombin time, 11 minutes; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; and direct bilirubin, 0.2 mg/dL.

Electrocardiogram was normal; no significant cardiac arrhythmia was detected.\nThe patient, who was admitted with frequent complaints of myalgia and fatigue, was diagnosed in the emergency department. Considering the clinical features, physical examination, and chest radiography, the patient was hospitalized with the diagnosis of suspected viral infection. However, considering COVID-19 infection to the epidemic area, atypical pneumonia virus infection had to be ruled out. On the same day, a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed, and small ground-glass nodules were seen, suggesting viral pneumonia scattered across the two lungs (). Two days later, a real-time reverse transcription\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of the patient\u2019s throat swab sample indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nWe hospitalized the male patient diagnosed with COVID-19. When we evaluated according to the WHO classification, we found that our patient had severe pneumonia. During hospitalization, hydroxychloroquine (first day 2 \u00d7 400 mg loading + 4 days 2 \u00d7 200 mg maintenance), oseltamivir (2 \u00d7 75 mg, 5 days), and azithromycin (first day 1 \u00d7 500 mg loading + 4 days 1 \u00d7 250 mg) therapy were used as recommended in the COVID-19 guidelines. The patient was quickly treated with a combination of IV fluids and sodium bicarbonate for alkalization. After five days of treatment, the patient\u2019s clinical condition deteriorated, and the patient\u2019s respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress developed, and SpO2 was \u2264 93% on room air. Favipiravir (first day 2 \u00d7 1,600 mg loading + 4 days 2 \u00d7 600 mg) antiviral treatment was added to the treatment of the patient, who was thought to develop severe pneumonia.

{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nOn March 26, 2019, a 6-year-old girl, was referred to our department for genetic evaluation of progressive scoliosis. She was the second child of non-consanguineous Korean parents. She was born at 35+3 weeks of gestation by caesarean section because of oligohydroamnios. Her birth weight was 2.7 kg and length was 52 cm. After birth, she was found to have severe hypotonia with a lack of spontaneous hand movement and wrist drop, which both led to upper brachial plexus palsy. Mild kyphosis was also observed. She presented with hyperextensible velvety skin, and easy bruising. As classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) was suspected and she had an elder sister with hyperelastic and fragile skin, DNA analysis of the COL5A1 gene was performed with normal results. The severe hypotonia led to delayed motor development. While undergoing physiotherapy, she began standing without assistance in kyphotic posture at the age of 21 months and could walk without support at age 3 years. On physical examination at age 6 years, her weight and height were 20 kg (25\u201350th percentile) and 116.8 cm (50\u201375th percentile), respectively. She presented with progressive kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, protruding abdomen, long and slender fingers and pes planovalgus. She showed slightly dysmorphic features including a prominent high forehead, malar hypoplasia, depressed nasal bridges, low set and prominent ears, minimal prognathism, and short philtrum. She had joint hypermobility (Beighton score 6/9), skin hyperelasticity, and multiple atrophic scars on the forehead, knees and back. She had high myopia and keratoconus. Her mother reported that she had ocular fragility and retinal detachment of the left eye after falling down on her face. A skeletal survey revealed thoracic spine dextroscoliosis with kyphotic accentuation in the thoracolumbar junction and both pes planus and genu varum (). Echocardiography revealed no pathological findings. She is currently wearing an orthopedic brace for scoliosis. At age 6 years 8 months, she could walk unsupported and jump, and, go up the stairs with support. Her intelligence was normal.\nA 9-year-old girl, the older sibling of previous patient, was the first child of nonconsanguineous Korean parents. She was born at 40 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery. Her birth weight was 2.4 kg. At birth, she had intraventricular and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She had hyperelastic and fragile skin, easily bruisable skin, and generalized hypermobile joints (Beighton score 6/9). She had high myopia and keratoconus. Her parents reported that she was suspected of having Marfan syndrome due to Marfanoid habitus in infancy. She often fell, which resulted in frequent subluxations of the shoulders and had easily bruisable skin by minor trauma. She was found with marked hypotonia and delayed motor development. She had left hemiparesis due to neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. However, no striking kyphoscoliosis was observed until recently. On physical examination at age 9 years, her height was 143.2 cm (90th percentile) and weight was 48 kg (97th percentile). She showed mild dysmorphic features such as a prominent high forehead, a broad nose, a depressed nasal bridge, low set and prominent ears, and a malar hypoplasia. Multiple atrophic scars were found on the forehead, lower back and knees. Skeletal radiographs revealed a mild scoliosis on thoracolumbar spine and both pes planus (). The echocardiography findings were normal. The bone density was within the normal ranges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed several oval-shaped high signal lesions in the bilateral periventricular white matter, which suggested sequelae of the periventricular leukomalacia. Currently, she has delayed motor and cognitive development. She walks with support and uses a wheelchair at school.\nBased on the clinical signs, hereditary connective tissue disorder was suspected. Next-generation sequencing using a targeted panel of 30 genes (ACTA2, ADAMTS10, ADAMTSL4, ATP6V0A2, B4GALT7, CBS, CHST14, COL11A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL9A1, COL9A2, ELN, FBLN5, FBN1, FBN2, MYH11, PLOD1, PYCR1, RIN2, SKI, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2) for connective tissue disorders was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of the patient. Library preparation and target enrichment were performed by hybridization capture and massively parallel sequencing was done on the Illumina MiSeqDX (Illuina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) generating 2 \u00d7 150 bp paired-end reads. Sequence reads were aligned to hg19 with Burrow-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.10, MEM algorithm). Duplicate reads were removed by using Picard (version 1.138). Local alignment, base quality recalibration, and variant calling was performed with Genome Analysis Tool kit (GATK version 3.5), samtools (version 0.1.19), FreeBayes (version 0.9.21-26-gbfd9832), and Scalpel (version 0.53). Variants were annotated by Variant Effect Predictor and dbNSFP. Common variants were removed with minor allele frequencies \u22651%, according to population databases. The average coverage depth was 230\u00d7, and 99.8% of the target bases were covered by more than 10\u00d7 sequence reads. Two novel variants that were not previously reported in kEDS were identified in PLOD1. The PLOD1 variants were identified in the compound heterozygous state in the two siblings and were validated by Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing of their parents revealed that c.926_934del was inherited from the father, resulting in an in-frame deletion of three amino acids leucine-arginine-leucine (p.Leu309_Leu311del). The c.2170_2172del was inherited from the mother, resulting in in-frame deletion of one amino acid phenylalanine (p.Phe724del) ().\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital (SCHBC 2020-02-005).

Arterial blood gas (ABG) on O2 of 10 L/minute showed PaO2\u2014104 mm Hg, PaCO2\u201445.8 mm Hg, pH\u20147.31, and HCO3\u201422.4 mmol/L. Her thyroid function tests, electrocardiogram, and 2D echo were within normal limits. Human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was raised\u2014694 U/L (140\u2013280 U/L). X-ray of the chest showed bilateral reticular infiltrates, which showed a progressive worsening in serial X-rays () over the past 1 year, and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed diffuse intralobular and interstitial thickening with ground-glass opacities (crazy-paving pattern) suggesting interstitial lung disease ( and ). Clinical and radiological features were suggestive of PAP, and further investigations were done to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage done in her previous hospital admission were inconclusive. It was negative for acid-fast bacilli, Pneumocystis carinii, and aerobic cultures, and galactomannan test was also negative. An autoimmune etiology was ruled out as an antibody against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was negative, and serum GM-CSF concentration was raised. Next-generation sequencing showed contiguous homozygous deletion encompassing exonic regions 1 to 5 of CSF2RA gene, suggestive of pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction 4, an X linked disorder confirming a diagnosis of PAP.\nShe was treated with steroids, antibiotics, and other supportive care. With a confirmed diagnosis of PAP due to CSF2RA gene mutation and the presence of severe respiratory insufficiency, a decision was made to perform a therapeutic WLL on ECMO.\n\nBased on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "output": "### Response:\n44.2", "task": "calc"}
{"input": "### Instruction:\n<calc>\nAn 11-year-old Japanese male (weight, 38.0 kg; height, 149.6 cm) was admitted to the hospital after having lost 3 kg of body weight in one month. He complained of neither subjective symptoms nor abdominal pain. He had undergone surgery for a perianal abscess at the age of nine years, but there were no signs of disease during treatment. He showed elevated serum amylase (AMY) and lipase levels of 524 U/L and 1,114 U/L, respectively. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scanning revealed slight pancreatic enlargement. He had a fever once during the course of the disease, but the levels of the pancreatic enzymes spontaneously decreased with fasting. On the 22nd day of hospitalization, he had a fever of 40\u2103, rigors, and low systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg. He was, therefore, transported to our hospital for intensive care.\nDuring our examination, he was restless, and his blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature were 75/35 mmHg (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 48 mmHg), 150 beats/min, 30 breaths/min, 98% and 38.2\u00b0C, respectively. There were no specific physical findings in the chest, abdomen, skin, or anus.\nArterial blood gas analysis showed a lactate level of 40 mg/dL, suggestive of lactic acidosis. The leukocyte count was 7,800/\u03bcL, the hemoglobin level was 9.2 g/dL, and the platelet count was 98,000/\u03bcL. The blood urea nitrogen level was 40.8 mg/dL, the creatinine level was 1.67 mg/dL, and the AMY level was 349 U/L. The lipase, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and blood sugar levels were all abnormal at 372 U/L, 12.99 mg/dL, over 100 ng/dL, and 49 mg/dL, respectively. Coagulation abnormalities were also present, with an activated partial thromboplastin time of 44.4 seconds, a prothrombin time of only 28.2% of the normal range, 44.2 \u03bcg/mL of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, a D-dimer level of 22.87 \u03bcg/mL, a fibrinogen level of 345 mg/dL, and an antithrombin III level of only 61.8% of the normal range. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10 points, and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) diagnostic criteria score was 6 points [,]. Abdominal CT revealed mild swelling in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas and multiple lymph node enlargements, but no obvious infectious findings such as abscesses or intestinal perforations (Figure ).\nMicrobiological testing detected Enterobacter cloacae in two sets of blood culture samples and Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Proteus mirabilis in the urine culture sample. Since the urine had a small amount of bacteria and no pyuria was observed, we judged it to be only bacterial carriage.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of septic shock and DIC due to an intra-abdominal infection. Crystalloid fluid infusion, meropenem (MEPM), thrombomodulin alfa (TM), noradrenaline (NA), and antithrombin (AT) were administered (Figure ). As the patient continued to be anuric despite massive infusions, continuous hemodialysis (CHD) and polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) were introduced. On the second day in the ICU, endotracheal intubation was performed, and he was placed on a ventilator owing to signs of worsening respiratory condition, including tachypnea and nasal alar breathing.\nAfter overnight administration of 4,000 mL of crystalloid fluid and a maximum dose of 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min of NA, a MAP of 65 mmHg was achieved, and serum lactate levels were decreased to 18 mg/dL by day 2 of being in the ICU.\nColonoscopy was performed to detect the source of the intra-abdominal infection on day 4 of being in the ICU. The erosions and ulcers had a tendency to run longitudinally, and skip lesions were observed (Figure ). As a result, CD was diagnosed. Since there were no other obvious findings, we assumed that the intestinal tract was the entry point for the infection in the bloodstream.\nOn day 7 of being in the ICU, the patient was extubated, and the blood purification therapy was terminated after CHD was exchanged for granulocytapheresis (G-CAP).\nOn the eighth day in the ICU, the patient was transferred to the general pediatric ward for the treatment of CD. On the 117th day of hospitalization, he was discharged in good general condition.\n\nWhat is the patient's body surface area?
